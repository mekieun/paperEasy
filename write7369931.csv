"AbstractIn order to control the spread of COVID-19, people must adopt preventive behaviours that can affect their day-to-day life."
People’s self-efficacy to adopt preventive behaviours to avoid COVID-19 contagion and spread should be studied.
"The aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically test the COVID-19 prevention, detection, and home-management self-efficacy scale (COVID-19-SES)."
We conducted an observational cross-sectional study.
Six-hundred and seventy-eight people participated in the study.
Data were collected between March and May 2020.
"The COVID-19-SES’ validity (content, criterion, and construct), reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability), and legibility were studied."
The COVID-19-SES’ reliability was high (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.906; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.754).
The COVID-19-SES showed good content validity (scale’s content validity index = 0.92) and good criterion validity when the participants’ results on the COVID-19-SES were compared to their general self-efficacy (r = 0.38; p  0.5 was deemed as appropriate [32].2.6.
"Phase 2: Final Validity, Reliability, and Legibility Analysis of the COVID-19-SESFollowing Streiner & Kottner’s recommendations, we tested the COVID-19-SES’ validity (i.e., content, criterion and construct) and reliability (i.e., internal consistency and test-retest reliability) [34]."
"Additionally, we explored the scale’s legibility and developed an internal scoring system [32,38]."
"We analysed the data using IBM® SPSS Statistics® v.25 (IBM Company, Chicago, IL, USA)."
The COVID-19-SES was created and tested in Spanish.
Four independent translators participated in the forward-backward procedure to translate the English version of the COVID-19-SES presented in this paper [39].
Two independent native English translators (proficient in Spanish) translated the COVID-19-SES from Spanish to English.
The small differences between their translations were reconciled by consensus and a single English version of the COVID-19-SES was created.
Two independent native Spanish translators (proficient in English) performed a backtranslation of the COVID-19-SES English version into Spanish.
"Again, small differences in their backtranslation were reconciled by consensus."
"The research team and the translators examined the original COVID-19-SES, its English translation, and the backtranslation in Spanish."
It was unanimously considered that the English version of the COVID-19-SES included in this paper respected the semantics of the original tool.2.6.1.
ValidityContent ValidityWe explored the COVID-19-SES’ content validity following the same method as the one described in phase 1.
"In addition, we calculated the scale’s content validity index (S-CVI)."
"We deemed appropriate a S-CVI higher than 0.78 [32].Criterion ValidityIn order to explore the instrument’s criterion validity, we correlated the participants’ results on the COVID-19-SES with their results on the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) [35]."
"Prior to this, we performed a normality test on the variable “mean_score_COVID”."
"The kurtosis (value = 1.78; SE = 0.20), skewness (value = −1.21; SE = 0.10), Shapiro-Wilk test (W(622) = 0.91; p  0.7 and a significant Bartlett’s test (χ2) were considered as indicators of the appropriateness to conduct an EFA [32,41,43]."
"The number of factors extracted as underlying dimensions of the COVID-19-SES was determined by: (1) the point where the curve of the scree plot clearly levelled off and (2) the number of factors with eigenvalues equal or higher than 1 [32,41,43]."
Items were considered to be part of a factor (or dimension) when their factor-loading coefficient was ≥ 0.45 [43].2.6.2.
"ReliabilityWe explored the COVID-19-SES’ reliability (i.e., internal consistency and test-retest reliability) following the same method as the one described in phase 1."
"Furthermore, we studied the correlations (Spearman’s correlation coefficient) between the COVID-19-SES and all its sub-dimensions [32].2.6.3."
"LegibilityWe analysed the COVID-19-SES’ legibility using the INFLESZ scale, which measures the difficulty of healthcare-related texts directed at laypeople [44]."
"According the INFLESZ scale, texts can be very easy (> 80), quite easy (66–80), normal (56–65), somewhat difficult (40–55), or very difficult ( 2 SD below the mean, (2) low self-efficacy = scores between 1–2 SD below the mean, (3) moderate self-efficacy = scores ≤ 1 SD below the mean, (4) high self-efficacy = scores ≤ 1 SD above the mean, and (5) very high self-efficacy = scores > 1 SD above the mean.3."

Pilot Study ResultsTable 1 summarises the results of the pilot study.
The experts considered that all the items were relevant to measure the intended construct (i-CVI > 0.78) and they were all kept as part of the COVID-19-SES that we administered to the pilot sample (N = 56).
The COVID-19-SES’ α was 0.905 and it would not have increased if we had removed any of the items.
All the items’ C-ITC was higher than 0.3.
"Furthermore, the average measure ICC was 0.917 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.86 to 0.91 (F(55,55) = 12.00, p < 0.001)."

Participants and Descriptive DataTable 2 summarises the participants’ characteristics.
The participants’ mean age was 35.80 (SD = 13.89) and they were 68.8% female (n = 428).
"Almost 40% of the participants had completed primary or secondary education, 31% had completed vocational training, and around 30% had completed a university degree, masters or PhD."
"In terms of participants’ occupation, almost 25% were unemployed (n = 153) and 20% were healthcare professionals (n = 125)."
The majority of participants had not been diagnosed with a respiratory or cardiovascular chronic condition (n = 543) and had not experienced COVID-19 symptoms (n = 411).
Most participants declared their health to be good (n = 352) or very good (n = 202).

ValidityContent validity analysis showed that all the items’ i-CVI > 0.78 (See Table 3) and the COVID-19-SES’ S-CVI was 0.92.
"In terms of criterion validity, our analysis indicated that the participants’ scores on the COVID-19-SES moderately correlated with their scores on the GSES (r = 0.38; p  1 and all the items loaded onto one factor with a factor-loading coefficient > 0.45."

ReliabilityTable 3 presents the items’ C-ITC and the scale’s α if the items were removed.
"The COVID-19-SES’ α was 0.906, all the items’ C-ITC > 0.3, and the scale’s α would not have increased if we had removed any of the items."
"Additionally, all the sub-dimensions’ α was higher than 0.70 (see Table 5)."
"Regarding test-retest reliability, 85% of participants completed the retest after 4 weeks (n = 531) and we found that the average measure ICC was 0.757 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.71 to 0.80 (F(530,530) = 4.12, p < 0.001)."

LegibilityThe results from the INFLESZ analysis (score = 68.04) showed that the COVID-19-SES was “quite easy” to read and understand by laypeople.
"Furthermore, none of the participants reported any difficulties to read, understand, or complete the scale.3.6."
Scoring and Interpretation SystemThe participants’ mean score on the COVID-19-SES was 83.32 (SD = 13.24).
"We developed the following internal scoring system: (1) very low self-efficacy = scores below 55, (2) low self-efficacy = scores 55–68, (3) moderate self-efficacy = scores 69–82, (4) high self-efficacy = scores 83–96, and (5) very high self-efficacy = scores above 96.4."
"DiscussionThe aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically test the COVID-19 prevention, recognition, and home-management self-efficacy scale (COVID-19-SES)."
"Bandura’s theoretical framework suggests that higher levels of self-efficacy indicate individuals’ higher motivation towards carrying out a given task [25,26]."
"In fact, self-efficacy has been linked to better preventive behavioural responses in a pandemic outbreak [24,27,28,29]."
"In an attempt to control the pandemic, many governments have urged the general public to confine themselves at home and/or to adopt protective behaviours that can alter their day-to-day life [10,12,18,19]."
"Developing an instrument for the assessment of individuals’ self-efficacy to adopt preventive measures would allow healthcare professionals to explore the general public’s behavioural responses amidst the public health emergency generated by the COVID-19 pandemic [19].When a psychometric instrument is developed, we have to carefully examine its validity and reliability [32,34]."
"Whilst validity refers to the instrument’s ability to actually measure the construct that it intends to measure [33,41], reliability refers to its ability to produce accurate and consistent results across time [32,33]."
"In this study, we assessed the COVID-19-SES’ validity and reliability."
"Furthermore, we analysed its legibility and created a scoring system to facilitate the interpretation of the results [32,38].Regarding the COVID-19-SES’ validity, we analysed its content, criterion, and construct validity [34]."
"A panel of 14 independent experts critically reviewed the COVID-19-SES and decided that all the items comprising the tool were relevant to measure individuals’ self-efficacy in preventing, recognising symptoms and home-managing COVID-19 [41]."
"In terms of criterion validity, our analysis showed that the participants’ results on the COVID-19-SES moderately correlated to their results on the general self-efficacy scale."
"Self-efficacy is situation-specific and people can be more or less efficacious in some realms than others [25,45]."
"Although both instruments assess people’s self-efficacy, they both refer to very different realms in their lives and this could explain why we found a moderate correlation between them."
"With regard to our construct validity analysis, we found that the COVID-19-SES has a three-dimension structure."
"The three dimensions of the COVID-19-SES allow for the assessment of people’s self-efficacy in preventing the contagion and spread of COVID-19, recognising COVID-19 symptoms, and home-managing patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms."
"These three dimensions are in line with the WHO’s recommendations for the general public to avoid the contagion and spread of COVID-19 [11,20]."
"In general, the results from our validity analysis suggest that the COVID-19-SES is a valid instrument for assessing the general public’s self-efficacy in their ability to adopt preventive behaviours to prevent, recognise symptoms, and home-manage COVID-19 [32,33,41]."
"In terms of reliability, our analysis has shown that all the items of the COVID-19-SES contribute to its strong internal consistency."
"Additionally, our test-retest reliability analysis suggests that the COVID-19-SES can yield consistent results across time."
"This evidence indicates that the COVID-19-SES can measure the general public’s self-efficacy in preventing, recognising symptoms, and home-managing COVID-19 in a reliable and consistent manner [32,33,41]."
"Contributing to the good psychometric properties of the tested instrument, our legibility analysis showed that the COVID-19-SES is easy to read, understand, and complete by laypeople [44]."
"Lastly, our descriptive analysis showed that our participants are highly efficacious in preventing, recognising symptoms, and home-managing COVID-19."
This could be related to the fact that the Spanish government has implemented strict measures to oblige the general public to implement protective measures against the contagion and spread of COVID-19 [19].
"Future research should use the COVID-19-SES to collect data about different populations’ self-efficacy in order to deepen our understanding of its mediating effect on people’s behavioural responses to the pandemic over time.Although we conducted a methodologically rigorous study, we need to highlight some limitations."
"Firstly, our sample was selected through a convenience sampling technique, which means that our results cannot be generalised."
"Although participants stated they were from 33 different provinces in Spain, we suggest that future studies use a stratified sampling method to recruit a representative sample."
"Secondly, our sample mainly comprised of young, healthy adults."
"It is important to test the COVID-19-SES’ main psychometric properties amongst samples of people with specific clinical, social, or behavioural backgrounds."
"Thirdly, the COVID-19-SES was developed and validated in Spanish."
"Although the instrument complies with the WHO’s recommendations to prevent the contagion and spread of COVID-19, its use in a different language should be preceded by a psychometric evaluation."
"Fourthly, due to the strict lockdown measures implemented by the Spanish government during the COVID-19 outbreak, we could only collect data through online surveying."
Populations with limited access to the Internet or social media may be unrepresented.
"Lastly, data were collected through self-administered questionnaires."
"Since the Spanish government decreed the state of alarm and people were obliged to comply with some of the preventive behaviours reflected in the COVID-19-SES [12], the study participants could have fallen into social desirability bias.5."
"ConclusionsFollowing an exhaustive assessment, the COVID-19-SES has shown to have good psychometric properties."
"Our results suggest that the COVID-19-SES is a valid, reliable, and legible instrument that would allow for the assessment of people’s self-efficacy in preventing, recognising symptoms, and home-managing COVID-19."
Healthcare professionals and behavioural scientists should use the COVID-19-SES to study both people’s level of confidence in their ability to adopt protective behaviours amidst future waves of the pandemic as well as the relationship between self-efficacy and people’s behavioural responses in a pandemic caused by an infectious respiratory disease.
The results yielded from the COVID-19-SES could provide information about people’s motivation to comply with the recommended protective behaviours.
"Therefore, healthcare professionals could use the COVID-19-SES when they require patients with (or suspected) mild COVID-19 symptoms and relatives to isolate themselves at home."
"Low levels of self-efficacy in preventing, recognising symptoms, and home-managing COVID-19 could indicate the need for health education interventions."
Future studies should focus on testing the COVID-19-SES amongst different populations in different socio-cultural contexts and confirming the tool’s dimensionality.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank all the participants and independent experts for volunteering to take part in this study.
