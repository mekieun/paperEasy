AbstractThese guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community.
They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data.
"Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells."
"The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed."
"Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.IntroductionContinuing my theme of the marriage between immunology and cytometry noted in my Introduction to the previous version of these Guidelines [1], long relationships always have periods in which the partners have contrasting feelings for each other, and may eventually divorce; however, this does not seem to be the case for immunology and cytometry, disciplines that continue with a very stable and incredibly productive marriage, as witnessed by the enormous number of publications in almost all areas of the immunology discipline that we all love."
"It is indeed almost impossible to count the original papers, reviews, abstracts, and meeting communications, and talks in which an immunologist, from undergraduate students to Nobel laureates, has measured a parameter of interest at the single cell, organelle, or even molecular level using one of the sophisticated cytometric technologies that we are discussing here.Unfortunately, measuring what happens in a biological system, starting from the single cell level (that is, ‘cyto’ for cell, ‘metry’ for measure) is not as simple as it seems, and can lead to results that are not always optimal."
"In most cases, flow cytometry is relatively easy to use, and often even a brief training—if not the simple reading of a bench manual or a rapid glance over a protocol—enables a researcher to use a flow cytometer and start producing data."
As we have already pointed out in ref.
"[1], paradoxically, this is a main weakness of cytometry."
"Indeed, a well-trained cytometrist can often identify in published papers experimental aspects or data that must be improved, if not fully redone."
"The importance of adequate controls, correct compensation, clean and well monitored sorting strategies, correct data analysis, presentation, and interpretation, and the description of the methods used cannot be stressed enough.It is for these reasons, a few years ago, following enthusiastic discussions at the European Congress of Immunology held in Vienna, September 2015, and under the guidance of Professor Andreas Radbruch (at that time Chair of the Executive Committee of the European Journal of Immunology (EJI) and currently EFIS President), that the Editorial Team of the European Journal of Immunology felt that it was worthwhile to offer our community guidelines for the correct use of cytometric techniques in the field of immunology."
"For this, we were able to put together a large team of renowned experts who prepared a first collection of protocols of interest for our community.In the previous version of the guidelines, which was authored by 236 scientists from 194 institutions spread across the world, we focused on core aspects including advice and best practice regarding how to study complex cell phenotypes, the type or amount of molecules produced or secreted after stimulation by the cell population of interest, signaling processes, differentiation, proliferation, cell death, cytotoxic activities, cell–cell interactions, the functionality of organelles such as mitochondria, the different types of response induced against tumours, transcription factor activity, quantification of soluble molecules, drug uptake, and rare events, not forgetting the parts related to the choice of reagents, the preparation and/or storage of the cells under analysis, the overall experimental plan, and last but not least, the analysis of data.But a good scientist knows that all efforts, including those collected in extensive guidelines like ours, can and must be improved."
"Accordingly, we asked for feedback on the published guidelines and received critical comments, new ideas, and suggestions for this new version, and here we are!"
"In this updated version, we have tried to ameliorate and update several parts and the reader will find more standardized sections that should make it easier to navigate throughout the text that now features novel tips and pitfalls to avoid."
"Importantly the phenotyping sections are clearly divided into human and murine sections, again to help the reader find the section most relevant to their work.There are also several new or expanded sections, with the phenotyping section covering all the major cell types including, for example, dendritic cells and their subsets, unconventional T cells, such as gamma delta, NKT or MAIT cells, B cells, and beyond, as well as sections covering the functional aspects of regulatory T cells and recently described assays on antigen specific cells."
"There is also the identification and characterization of bone marrow and cord blood neutrophils, plus liver cells and brain/neural cells are actors that play a crucial role in the economy of the immune system and can now be analyzed by cytometric assays."
"Soluble molecules have received particular attention with cytokine-producing cell sorting with secretion assays, as well as the quantification of soluble cytokines with cytometric bead arrays, are now described."
"A discussion regarding single cell genomics and cytometry is also present, along with novel cytometric views on the microbiota, methods to detect inflammasome assembly and activation in immune cells, and assays related to multidrug resistance.The importance of the optimal organization of a laboratory is self-evident, and clearly highlighted in the new sections that describe how to perform flow cytometry under GLP/GMP conditions, how to set up and maintain a core facility, including house-keeping/shared resource lab management, as well as covering the importance of sample banking and high-throughput screening methods.There is no need to underline how fundamental and complex data analysis is, especially when we are coping with polychromatic and high dimensional flow cytometry, and are able to detect dozens of antigens in a cell—not to mention mass cytometry."
"As an aside, who will be the first to measure 100 parameters in a single cell by using a cytometric assay?"
"Thus, new sections are now present that discuss neuronal networks, dimensionality reduction, methods for clustering and creating trajectories, and integration of cytometric data into multi-omics analysis among others."
"We would like to stress once again that today the limit for asking critical questions is our creativity, and certainly not the instruments, the technology, or the bioinformatics approach that we can use in our experiments.The following three points have already been flagged in the previous version of the Guidelines but we would nonetheless like to remind our readers that, first, “FACS” (fluorescence activated cell sorting) should only be used for Becton Dickinson (BD) technologies as it is a BD trademark (FACS™); the more general term “flow cytometry” (for the pure analysis of the cells of interest) or “flow cytometry cell sorting” (obviously, if one sorts cells) should be used to be company agnostic and correct."
"Second, CD mAbs and not anti-CD mAbs (in other words, CD1 mAb and not anti-CD1 mAb for example) should be used."
This is because the CD nomenclature is primarily a system to cluster/characterize mAbs and it was only later accepted to use this system to also describe the respective CD molecules.
"Third, although the Guidelines are as comprehensive as possible, there are naturally limitations, e.g., only a subset of antibodies and antigens are shown and, at times, only certain reagents/companies are used as examples, and others work in the same excellent manner.In conclusion, we would like to thank the people who played a major role in ensuring that Andreas Radbruch’s and Andrea Cossarizza’s vision became a reality."
"These are Hyun-Dong Chang and Ute Hoffman, both at the DRFZ (Berlin), and Karen Chu, former Associate Editor, who were instrumental in getting the first version of the guidelines in place."
"For the revision, Nadja Bakocevic (Associate Editor), Sylvia Heider (Editorial Assistant), Cate Livingstone (Managing Editor), and Laura Soto-Vazquez (Associate Editor) of the European Journal of Immunology, together with Hyun-Dong Chang and Ute Hoffman, worked tirelessly together with the authors and those providing feedback to ensure that this revised version is a significant improvement."
"It is a job that is never done as, due to time limits, some suggestions could not be incorporated but we feel that this version will continue to provide invaluable advice for the immunology community.I."
Cytometry equipment1.
Fluidic system of a flow cytometer1.1.
"Purposes of the fluidic system of a flow cytometer To accurately measure optical properties of cells with a flow cytometer, cells have to pass through the uniformly bright center of focused laser beams."
Light collection optics is focused on the intersection point of cells with the laser beams to pick up fluorescence and scattered light from cells.
"This is the sensing zone of a flow cytometer, here, the measurements of cell parameters are taken."
"In stream-in-air cell sorters, the sensing zone is located around 0.3 mm under the nozzle tip, in other cytometers it is located inside a cuvette.One purpose of the fluidic system is to move the cells one by one precisely through the sensing region in a liquid stream in such a way that each cell is illuminated by the same amount of light from the lasers.In cytometers with sort capabilities or cell sorters, the fluidic system has to establish a stable break off from the liquid stream in small uniform droplets."
Droplets containing the cells of interest can be charged and deflected in an electric field for sorting.This kind of cell sorting technique was invented by Mack J. Fulwyler in 1965 at Los Alamos National Laboratory [2].
"Mack Fulwyler needed a machine for testing the performance of Coulter counters, so the first particle separator was used for sorting of particles with different Coulter volumes."
"Len Herzenberg was interested in a machine that could sort living cells on the basis of fluorescence, he got the design plans of the particle separator from Mack Fulwyler and found a little group at Stanford University to build the first FACS in the late 1960s (see the video Inventing the Cell Sorter, Herzenberg Lab, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro8P3w9BPhg).1.2."
"Hydrodynamic focusing For precise positioning of cells in a liquid jet, the hydrodynamic focusing technique is used in most cytometers and cell counters [3].The cells in suspension are injected by a thin tubing in a laminar flow of a sheath fluid that enters from a wide tubing into a narrow tubing or small orifice."
The sheath flow speeds up when it enters the narrow tubing and the diameter of sheath and sample flow (sample core) is decreased (Fig.
1).
Crosland-Taylor described this technique first in Nature 1953 [4] and used it in a device for counting small particles suspended in a fluid.
"Some years before in 1947, F.T."
Gucker used a similar technique for detecting bacteria in a laminar sheath stream of air [5].Open in a separate windowFigure 1.Sample core after hydrodynamic focussing by laminar sheath flow in a flow chamber.The hydrodynamic focusing takes place in the so-called flow chamber or flow cell of a cytometer.
"A detailed description of an optimized flow chamber for a stream-in-air cell sorter can be found in the patent applications from Gerrit van den Engh [6, 7]) and a flow chamber of a cuvette system is found in another patent application from BD [8].In addition to flow chambers for laser based cytometers, flow chambers with hydrodynamic focusing for cytometers with an arc lamp light source were developed."
These early cytometers were based on a standard fluorescence microscope with epi- fluorescence setup.
"Here, the same microscope lens is used to bring excitation light to the cells and take fluorescence emission from the cells."
Excitation and emission light is separated by a dichroic mirror and special filters.
"With an immersion microscope lens of high numerical aperture, a stabilized arc lamp and optimized staining protocol, and DNA histograms with coefficient of variations (CVs) lower than 1% (0.50–0.7%) were achieved [9, 10].With the hydrodynamic focusing technique, cells can be aligned to a precision of one micrometer."
"With high sample flow rates the sample core is increased, however, and cells in the sample core can move out of the focus center of the laser."
"Thus, not all cells get the same amount of laser illumination."
"This means that the accuracy of measurements is lost.To avoid loss of measurement precision when the sample core increases and to maintain laser intensity, cytometers use elliptical laser focus spots."
Typical sizes of focus spot are 60–150 μm horizontally and 5–20 μm vertically.
"Recently, beam shaping optics for flat top focused laser beams were introduced in flow cytometers by the manufacturer."
"The intensity profile of a Gaussian laser beam with 60, 100, and 150 μm focus diameters is shown in Fig."
2.Open in a separate windowFigure 2.Intensity profile of a focus spot of a gaussian laser beam.
"Note: if a cell is out of the center of the laser focus by 10 μm (20 μm sample core), laser intensity goes down about 5% with a 60 μm diame ter laser focus.An approximation of the sample core diameter d in micrometers is given in ref."
"[11] as follows:d=1.13∗1000∗u/nv2 with u = particle measurement rate in particle per second, n =particle concentration in particle/mL, and v = jet velocity in m/s.An approximation of the jet velocity is given byv=3,7∗deltaP2with v in m/s and delta P, the sheath pressure drop at the nozzle in psi (in practice around the pressure on the sheath container minus 1 to 3 psi pressure drop on tubings and sterile filter).The approximation of the sample core diameter calculation shows that for a ten times lower sample concentration a more than three times bigger sample core diameter is necessary to keep the particle measurement rate.For the sheath fluid, PBS (phosphate buffered saline) filtered through a 0.22 or 0.1 μm filter is often used."
The sheath fluid should be compatible with cells or species that have to be sorted.1.3.
"Acoustic focusing of particles in a liquid stream An acoustic focusing technology was developed by Gregory Kaduchak and co-workers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2001 and introduced to flow cytometry [12, 13]."
"Recently, the acoustic focusing technique was implemented into a flow cytometer to support hydrodynamic focusing."
This technique helps to increase measurement precision in particular if wide sample cores are used.
"According to the manufacturer, cytometers with acoustic-assisted hydrodynamic focusing can run samples with low concentrations of cells up to ten times faster as compared with cytometers without and still maintain the precision of the measurements."
The fundamentals of acoustic cytometry are given in ref.
[14].1.4.
"Droplet generation of a cell sorter Based on the invention from Richard Sweet [15], droplet formation of the liquid jet of a cell sorter is stabilized by vibrations of an ultrasonic transducer.Little disturbances on the surface of the liquid jet at the exit of the nozzle orifice are generated by the transducer."
"The disturbances grow exponentially and lead to break up of the jet in little droplets [3, 11]."
A cell of interest that should be sorted is measured at the sensing zone and moves down the stream to the breakoff point.
"During the separation of the droplet with the cell in it from the intact liquid jet, a voltage pulse is given to the liquid jet."
So electrons are caught with the cell in a droplet and cannot go back when the droplet is separated from the liquid stream and the voltage pulse is shut off.
The droplet with the cell is charged and can be deflected in a static electric field of two deflection plates for sorting (Fig.
3).Open in a separate windowFigure 3.Liquid stream of a jet in air sensing cell sorter.
"Depending of abort settings of the cell sorter, cells that are too close together are aborted from sorting."
Reproduced with permission from ref.
[16].It is important for the sorting process that the cell of interest is at the right place when a voltage pulse is given to the liquid jet to charge a droplet.
The delay from the measurements of cell parameters to the charging pulse is determined by the cell sorter operator or by the cell sorter electronics.
This is done with the help of fluorescent beads and a laser beam under the deflection plates.
The laser beam illuminates the streams of deflected and undeflected droplets.
"The fluorescent beads are sorted all in one direction, and with a camera, the fluorescence in the droplet streams is observed on a monitor."
During observation of the fluorescent spots the drop delay is changed so that the brightness of the fluorescence of the deflected droplet stream is maximized and the brightness of the fluorescence of the un-deflected droplet stream is minimized.
The distance from the sensing zone to the break off point is controlled by a microscope and held constant.The delay setting is fixed during sorting and in general the break off distance is kept constant by the operator.
"If the velocity of the liquid jet is constant during sorting the sorting works fine, but in practice this is not always the case."
"Small changes of sheath pressure, for example, due to partial clogging of the sheath filter can alter jet velocity during sorting."
Petersen and van den Engh have examined the problem and showed how little variations of sheath pressure can disturb the sorting process and how the operator can handle it [17].
Toralf Kaiser examined how temperature changes of sheath fluid alters sorting performance and gives a solution for stabilizing sheath fluid temperature [18]).A schematic of a typical fluid system of a cell stream-in-air sorter is shown in Fig.

Optics and electronics2.1.
"Introduction From a technical point of view, a flow cytometer is a light detection device capable of detecting photons of different wavelengths over a high dynamic range."
"In order to achieve a high dynamic range, the optics, signal detection, and processing units must be carefully designed.2.2."
Optics 2.2.1.
"Lenses In flow cytometers, lenses are used to collect light emitted from the cell of interest, i.e., due to their spatial resolution they collect light only from the point of interest."
"Furthermore, they are used to make the collected light parallel in order to direct it through the optical bench to the detectors."
A flow cytometer employs collection and collimation lenses.
"Collection lenses (convex lenses) are used to focus the light from the interrogation point either to the end of an optical fiber or directly to a collimation lens (e.g., aspheric condenser lenses)."
"Some instruments use optical fibers to route the detected light to detectors, which are installed in an octagon."
"In this case, a collimation lens is installed at the other end of the fiber to ensure that all light is routed parallel through the octagon."
Inside the octagon another collimation lens is placed in front of each detector to focus the parallel light onto the photocathode.
In instruments without fiber optics the parallel light is routed through the optical bench and then focused onto the photocathode by a collimation lens.2.2.2.
Optical filter The photodetectors used in flow cytometers are spectrally broadband and therefore unable to generate a signal exclusively from specific wavelengths and thus specific markers.
"To add specificity, optical filters and dichroic mirrors are used in a well defined manner to route the light to the detectors."
"Optical filters are designed as band pass (BP), long pass (LP), or short pass (SP) filters, and are mostly installed in front of the light detectors."
The common property of the filters is that they transmit light only within a spectral range.
An LP filter transmits light below a certain wavelength.
"For example, a LP of 660 nm will transmit all light above 660 nm."
"In contrast, SP filters will pass short wavelengths and block longer ones."
A BP filter transmits light in a certain wavelength range.
"For example, if the BP is named as 660/20, this means that light between 650 and 670 nm will pass through the filter."
Dichroic mirrors are also used to allocate light to a specific detector based on wavelength.
"Like optical filters, dichroic mirrors are separated in LP and SP versions."
"To achieve maximum sensitivity, dichroic LPs are installed closer to the light source (flow cell) to first direct long-wave photons onto the light detector."
"Due to aging, quality of coating, and contamination, the actual parameter of an optical filter or dichroic mirror can differ from the technical description."
"Therefore, it is recommended to check the transmission spectra of new filters provided by the manufacturer and always keep filters dust free."
Sometimes mirrors (usually silver mirrors) are used in the optical bench of a flow cytometer in order to deflect light for geometrical or constructive reasons.
These filters are >99% reflective over a wide range of wavelengths.2.2.3.
"Dispersing elements Recently, commercial cytometers have become available which use spatially dispersing elements instead of or in combination with optical filters in order to deflect light wavelength specific to a detector array."
"The rationale behind this is the measurement of the entire emission spectra of a cell (see section I.3 Flow cytometry, including flow cytometry cell sorting)."
A dispersing element can be a dispersive prism or a grating.
Prisms have a higher light efficiency over gratings and they are not sensitive for polarized light.
This maybe the reason why they are employed in the spectral flow cytometer from Sony.
A dispersing element is installed between the interrogation point and a detector array.2.2.4.
"Laser Lasers employed for flow cytometers are mainly solid-state, continuous wave lasers."
Such lasers have a small footprint and a typical output power range from 20 to 100 mW.
"Lasers are coherent light sources that allow a high photon density at the illumination point, and therefore an efficient energy transfer to the fluorochrome.2.3."
"Electronics As a flow cytometer measures the biological information of a particle (e.g., a cell) via photons, this light needs to be converted to electrons and processed by an amplifier, filter, analog to digital converter (ADC), and baseline restorer in order to visualize and store the biological information of the cells or other particles."
"In this section, the main components of cytometer electronics are briefly described.2.3.1."
"Detectors From a technical point of view, the detection of cell related light is difficult due to (i) the low light level, (ii) the high analysis rate, and (iii) the high dynamic range of the light level."
Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) meet these requirements and are therefore employed in almost all flow cytometers.
"PMTs are vacuum tubes containing a photocathode, electron focusing electrodes, and a series of dynodes for electron multiplication."
The photocathode converts photons to photoelectrons that are then multiplied by a series of dynodes driven by a high voltage (Fig.
5).
"Photocathodes of PMTs employed in flow cytometers are made from bialkali material that determines the spectral quantum efficiency η of the PMT, which is the ratio of emitted electrons to incident photons."
The quantum efficiency of the photocathode is always 0  700 nm [19].Open in a separate windowFigure 5.Typical electronic signal processing of a flow cytometer.
The signal coming from a PMT or photo diode is amplified by a preamp and a main amp.
The analogue signals are then digitized by an ADC board.
A personal computer (PC) is used for further data processing and HV controlling.2.3.2.
Amplifier and signal processing Amplifiers in a flow cytometer can be grouped as pre- and main amplifiers.
Pre-amplifiers are either voltage (VA) or transimpedance (TIA) amplifiers that are used to amplify the voltage amplitude of a PMT (VA) or to convert a signal current of a photodiode to a voltage (TIA).
"Furthermore, pre-amplifiers perform operations, such as:impedance matching,filtering and pulse shaping,and bandwidth limiting.All amplifiers in a cytometer are analogue hardware devices which must be very well designed for optimal signal to noise ratios (SNRs)."
In a typical cytometer such amplifiers have an SNR of >86 dB.
"Once the signals are processed by the pre-amplifiers, the main amplifier moves the signal level to a suitable range for the ADC (Fig."
"5).In modern cytometers, the conversion of the continuous analog voltage signal into discrete digital values is done by ADCs that are defined by their sampling frequency and sample resolution."
"The required dynamic detection range (DNR) of a flow cytometer can be defined as the intensity range of stained and unstained cells, for example."
A stained cell can be 10 000 times brighter than an unstained cell that gives a DNR of 4 log or 80 dB (DNR[dB]=20log(104)).
"The DNR of an ideal ADC is given by: DNR = 6.02*N + 1.76 dB [20].This means that in theory, an ADC with N = 14 bit will have a DNR of 86.04 dB."
"In practice, the effective number of bits of an ADC is, due to noise and distortion of the circuit, some decibels below the theoretical value (e.g., the ADC AD9240AS of the BD Diva electronic has 78.5 dB [21])."
"This limits the dynamic range to less than 4 decades and, more importantly, shrinks the resolution of dim signals.The sampling frequency of the AD9240AS is 10 MHz that results in 30 samples per measured pulse of a high speed cell sorter (pulse length = 3 μs)."
This results in a peak detection error of 1–2% [22].
"Modern ADCs have a resolution of 16 bit and a sampling frequency of 250 MHz which allows the design of flow cytometers with dynamic range of >4 decades and a peak detection error of <0.1%.In the digital domain, the signals are processed by filters, baseline restorer, pulse height, pulse width algorithms, and trigger (see Section I.3)."
Filtering is done to smooth the raw PMT signal in order to improve the SNR.
The resulting signal consists of an unwanted DC part due to laser scatter light and electronic noise (among others) and a specific AC part.
"Hence, the DC part is subtracted by baseline restorers to increase the SNR and the DNR of the cytometer."
The baseline restorer attempts to keep the baseline at zero.
"In practice, however, baseline restoring is not perfect and can lead to negative values on the histogram axis or introduce a slight distortion of low signals and therefore to an increased CV of dim signals."
"After baseline restoring, the pulse parameters (height, width, and area) are extracted and converted into a *.fcs file.Taken together, the analogue and digital components of a flow cytometer in combination with the baseline and pulse shaping algorithms need to be well adjusted in order to maximize SNR and DNR.3."
"Flow cytometry, including flow cytometry cell sorting3.1."
"Convention, or fluorescence-activated flow cytometry and sorting Since the invention of the first prototype of a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter in 1968 at Stanford University, the technology has become a powerful tool to analyze and sort individual cells based on their functional status."
"Moreover, flow cytometry provides a robust statistic of thousands of individual cells and can detect rare events at a frequency below 10−4 cells."
The sample uptake by the instrument can be done from tubes or multi-well plates at an acquisition rate of thousands of cells/s.
"In a typical cytometer, the sensitivity decreases with increasing flow rate due to the increasing diameter of the cell stream within the flow cell."
"Alternatively, the AttuneNXT (ThermoFisher) uses acoustic-assisted hydrodynamic focusing, which helps keeping the core stream tight and therefore gives accurate results even at a much higher sample throughput."
"Furthermore, the serial acquisition of multiple cell samples can be automated by using high-throughput platforms (HyperCyt®).Today, instruments are available designed to detect up to 27 different bio-markers on an individual cell."
"Typically these markers are fluorescently tagged antibodies, molecular sensors, as well as genetically encoded reporters."
"For instance, the FACSymphony™ (Becton Dickinson) is technically capable of detecting up to 50 parameters of an individual cell."
"In practice, this high number of parameters is not achievable because at the moment the range of appropriate fluorescent dyes is limited.Technical limitations regarding the maximum number of detectable markers are also given by the overlap of the emission spectra of the different fluorescent tags, since each fluorescence detection channel is correlated to a biological marker."
"To overcome this, fluorescent tags became available that have different excitation wavelengths."
"Currently, up to seven lasers with emission wavelengths from 325 to 808 nm are used in order to achieve a high flexibility in the choice of the fluorescent tags."
"Furthermore, tunable lasers are used for special applications like fluorescent life time measurements (FLIMs).Flow cytometers use either PMTs or avalanche diodes to convert the emitted or scattered light into amplified electrical pulses that are processed by appropriate electronics to extract information like pulse height, area, length, and time."
"The electronics of the cytometer consist basically of a preamp circuit, baseline restoration circuit, and an ADC."
"In most modern cytometers, the data post-processing (i.e., pulse integration, compensation, log-transformation) and data analysis is done in a computer by software."
"All components together must have a low noise level (i.e., a high SNR) to achieve high instrument sensitivity (Q) and low background (B) detection.Avalanche diodes have better detection efficiency in long wavelengths and thus a better SNR in that range over PMTs."
"Furthermore, they open new possibilities for the application of fluorescent tags with long-wave emission spectra."
Avalanche diodes are implemented in the CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter) cytometer.
"Within this instrument, the emitted fluorescence light is divided by a wavelength division multiplexer (WDM) through a series of band pass filters and integrated optics, onto an array of avalanche diodes that enables a high sensitivity in the detection of, e.g., PE-Cy7.Avalanche diodes or PMTs itself are light detectors that are unsuitable for wavelength detection, hence, the fluorescent light needs to be filtered by optical filters and mirrors."
"These filters must be carefully chosen because a multiparameter experiment, i.e., an experiment in which multiple parameters (markers) are analyzed, requires that multiple fluorophores are used simultaneously; a consequence of this is spectral overlap or spillover (see Section II.1 Compensation).Conventional flow cytometers circumvent this problem by compensation (see Section II.1 Compensation) in order to accurately correlate the physical light properties with the biological properties of the cell."
"Following this, the data are analyzed in a multivariate fashion in combination with a hierarchical gating strategy (see Section VII.1 Data analysis).It is essential to adapt the combination of fluorescent tags to the given optical, laser, and electronic setup of the instrument to minimize spillover, increase Q, and lower B signals."
"For instance, by choosing the right concentration of a certain reagent (see Section III.2 Titration: Determining optimal reagent concentration), the fluorochrome related B can be optimized such that it contributes ideally nothing to the B given by the instrument."
This can help to increase the separation (the distance between the means) between a blank and a fluorescent population that is a function of Q and B.
"Thus, it requires the characterization of Q and B of the used instrument.Mostly polystyrene particles (beads) are used for this purpose in combination with software based protocols implemented in the instruments, e.g., MACS®Quant, Fortessa, Yeti, Cytoflex to name just a few."
"Beads are small particles and so to say “cell dummies” of well-defined fluorescent intensity and sizes that also can be used for PMT voltage optimization, compensation setup, cell counting, scale calibration, and so on.Scale calibration is an especially useful approach to measure absolute values (e.g., number of binding antibodies, amount of fluorescent molecules or photoelectrons) instead of relative mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs), which leads to quantitative flow cytometry (see Section VII)."
"Beside beads, scale calibration can also be achieved by using LED light pulses."
"Recently, the quantiFlash™ (APE) tool has become available that provides ultra stable LED light pulses."
"Furthermore, by using this tool, instruments can be compared within or between labs regarding their Q and B values.Up to this point, analytical cytometers have been described but cells can, in addition, be sorted based on specific marker expression for downstream analysis (molecular biology, sequencing, etc.)"
or cell culture (see Section II).3.2.
"Spectral flow cytometry: Principles and evolution For spectral flow cytometry, the “one detector, one marker” paradigm is changed."
After excitation (Fig.
"6A), the complete emitted light of a marker (Fig."
6B) is spectrally dispersed either by refraction within a prism or by diffraction within a grating (Fig.
6C) over a highly sensitive photo detector array (Fig.
6D).
Gratings are susceptible for polarized light.
"As polarization occurs frequently in flow cytometry [23], the total efficiency of a grating may be reduced."
"In fact, prisms are better suited for spectral light dispersion because they have a better light transmission and are also stable for polarized light."
"Unfortunately, the dispersion of a prism is not linear with regard to the wavelength, which makes it difficult to use linear detector arrays such as multianode PMTs [24].Open in a separate windowFigure 6.Principle of a spectral flow cytometer."
"(A) Excitation light source (laser), (B) labeled cell, (C) dispersing element, (D) multichannel light detector (CCD or multichannel PMT).As mentioned above, multianode PMTs or charge-coupled devices (CCDs) can be used as detector arrays."
CCDs have a high quantum efficiency of 80–90% in the visible range (500–800 nm) and a relative long readout time that limits the acquisition rate.
"On the other hand, this in combination with high spectral resolution allows the spectral detection of Raman scattering, which is a characteristic spectrum of molecular vibrations, much narrower than fluorescence spectra."
"This allows the application of new biological markers, such as surface enhanced Raman scattering tags or near infrared fluorescent dyes [25, 26].Spectral flow cytometry was introduced in 1979 [27], when the cytometric measurement of FITC- and PI-labeled mouse cells was demonstrated using a video camera tube as a detector."
"More recently, Robinson et al."
developed a single cell spectral flow cytometer based on a grating and PMT array [28–31].
This instrument created single cell spectra and demonstrated a spectral flow cytometer based on a 32-channel PMT array detector using a holographic grating and showed the detection and analysis of labeled lymphocytes and microspheres in hyperspectral space.
Goddard et al.
[32] employed a grating spectrograph attached to an intensified CCD for measuring microspheres and cells.
"This spectrograph was implemented in the optical pathway of a conventional flow cytometer and was able to take spectra of single cells and microspheres as well as to discriminate free versus bound propidium iodide.The first commercially available spectral flow cytometer, the SP6800, was developed by Sony [33]."
This instrument employs a prism array to disperse the collected light over a 32-channel multianode PMT.
"Moreover, the instrument is equipped with three lasers (405, 488, and 638 nm), which allow for full spectral detection of the resulting emission spectra."
The measured spectra from single cells are subsequently unmixed by using reference spectra of all used dyes and the autofluorescence spectrum.
"Least Square Fitting algorithms are used to calculate the most accurate fit for all reference spectra, leading to an accurate determination of which dyes are present on each cell and at which intensity."
"Using this method, a complete fluorescence emission is used instead of only a small portion of emitted light entering a dedicated detector through a specific set of mirrors and optical filters."
"This is a major advantage over conventional flow cytometry, in which light that is lost outside of the optical filters also contaminates other channels with unwanted light that has to be corrected by a subtractive method (see Section II.1 Compensation)."
"Since dyes frequently used in flow cytometry have rather broad emission spectra and large spectral overlaps, spectral unmixing can help mitigate this problem."
"Therefore, applications for spectral flow cytometry are similar to those performed on conventional flow cytometers with the additional benefit of spectral unmixing, which allows spectrally overlapping dyes to be measured, and auto-fluorescence subtraction to be included."
"Moreover, control of reagents (especially tandem dyes) is paramount with the increased need for standardization."
"Given that spectral flow cytometry shows full spectrum unbiased data, quality control is more or less integrated.In this fashion, spectral flow cytometers are designed to measure the biological information across multiple detection channels, where the optical configuration can be fixed for all experiments, giving the added benefit of instrument stability, sensitivity [34], and easier standardization across instruments, aided by the lack of individual PMTs and individual optical filters and mirrors.II."
Setup—Instrument setup and quality control1.
Compensation1.1.
"Introduction In flow cytometry, fluorescence spillover (i.e., which can be overcome by compensation) is probably the single greatest source of frustration for the scientist and cause of bad data."
Correctly compensating for spillover is critical to accurately identify populations in multicolor flow experiments.
Errors in compensation for one fluorochrome can be propagated into other detectors resulting in erroneous “virtual” positive populations or errors in population percentages due to incorrect gating.
"Mastering fluorescence spillover is much like chess, the rules are simple, but becoming a skilled practitioner can take some effort."
"Here, the basic concepts of fluorescence spillover are reviewed and some simple principles to follow in order to maximize data quality are provided, while debunking some of the myths that surround this field."
"For further information on this subject, readers are referred to the following references: [35–38]."
"In addition, a guide as to the Minimum Information about a Flow Cytometry experiment has been developed and vetted by the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) [39]."
This includes recommendations for ways to document compensation of complex panels.1.2.
"Principle of spillover and compensation Fluorescence spillover is the amount of signal, measured in median fluorescence intensity (MdFI), that a fluorochrome emits in a secondary detector specific for a different fluorochrome (Fig."
7A shows the fluorochrome PerCP-Cy5.5 is spilling into the PE-Cy7 detector [dark red]).
This is equivalent to a background in that detector.
We can calculate a spillover value (SOV) of PerCP-Cy5.5 into PE-Cy7 as Y/X × 100% (Fig.
"7B, left)."
Compensation is the mathematical process used in all flow cytometers and software in which these SOVs are used to determine a compensation matrix that effectively subtracts/corrects background due to spillover in all detectors (Fig.
"7B, right).Open in a separate windowFigure 7.Spillover and compensation: (A) the emission spectra of PerCP-Cy5.5 and PE-Cy7."
(B) Peripheral blood lymphocytes stained with PerCP-Cy5.5 CD4 mAb.
The MdFI is shown for the PerCP-Cy5.5 and PE-Cy7 detectors without (left) and with (right) compensation.The accuracy of this correction is totally dependent upon the accuracy of the SOVs determined from the appropriate single-color compensation controls.
In Fig.
"7B, the spillover is correct when the MdFI [PE-Cy7] of the PerCP-Cy5.5 positive (+) population is equal to the MdFI [PE-Cy7] of the PerCP-Cy5.5 negative (−) population."
"With a few exceptions, the mathematical calculation of SOVs is the same for all cytometers and flow cytometry software packages.1.3."
"Measuring SOVs/compensation controls On all cytometers, SOVs should be determined using single-color compensation controls."
Most errors in calculating SOVs are due to the use of inappropriate compensation controls.
A compensation control should consist of a positively stained population and a negative or unstained population.
The positive and negative populations do not need to be run in the same tube.
Cytometer and software protocols will specify what combinations can be used.
"It is never good practice to try to run two controls in the same tube, for example, using FITC CD4 mAb and PE CD19 mAb."
"This makes the assumption that there is absolutely no antibody bound to the “negative” cells, which is typically not the case.Many software packages from flow cytometer manufactures and third party companies have an “auto-compensation” feature."
"While these can be very powerful, they are based on automated gating algorithms in which the software identifies the positive and negative populations."
These gates may not always be appropriate.
"It is recommended that for new controls the user confirm that the software is providing correct gates and results.In general, correct SOVs can be obtained by following four simple principles for single-color compensation controls:The fluorescence spectrum of the compensation control fluorochrome-conjugated reagent should be identical to the reagent used in the experiment."
"More specifically, the fluorochrome should be identical not similar."
"For example, even though Alexa Fluor® 488 and FITC are spectrally very similar, an Alexa Fluor® 488 compensation control cannot be used for a FITC reagent or vice versa."
"Other examples are allophycocyanin (APC)/Alexa Fluor® 647 and APC-Cy7/ APC-H7.This principle is especially critical for tandem reagents (e.g., PE-Cy7, APC-Cy7) where there can be significant spectral differences from lot to lot, which can lead to differences in the SOV [40]."
"In such cases, it is recommended that users run individual single-color, lot-specific compensation controls.The autofluoresence of the positive and negative populations must be equivalent."
"The spillover calculation assumes that any difference in the MdFI of the spillover detector (e.g., Y in Fig."
"7A, left) is due to the presence of the fluorochrome measured by the primary detector."
"If the autofluoresence differs, then part of the MdFI in the spillover detector will be due to the difference in autofluoresence and not the fluorochrome itself."
An example is shown in Table 1.
"In measuring the SOV of FITC into PE when similarly autofluorescent positive and negative cells are used, the calculated SOV is 27%; however, incorrectly using beads for the negative population results in an SOV of 22%, a 5% error.Table 1.The consequences of using positive and negative populations with differing autofluoresence: Lymphocytes were stained with diluted FITC CD4 mAb."
"The MdFI of the CD4+ [Cells (+), unstained [Cells (−)] cells and unstained beads [Beads (−)] were measured in the FITC and PE detectors."
SOVs were calculated using positive and negative cells or positive cells and negative beadsFluorescence (MdFI)FITCPESOVCells (+)3135903n/aCells (−)957827%Beads (−)10722822%Open in a separate windowThis also applies to cell types.
Cell lines and untransformed lymphocytes should not be used for the same control.
"If a stained cell line is used as a positive control, the same unstained cell line should be used as a negative control."
"It is similar with cell subsets, for example, if lymphocytes are analyzed, lymphocytes, and not monocytes, should be used as both the positive and negative control."
"Some software programs allow a universal negative population (e.g., unstained lymphocytes); however, this is acceptable only as long as all analyzed samples are exclusively lymphocytes.Myth: the SOV depends upon the type and autofluoresence of the cells you are analyzing."
False.
The SOV is only a function of the fluorochrome.
"When correctly measured, the SOV is independent of the cell type(s) in the biological sample.The positive population should be as bright as possible.As noted earlier, the SOV is equal to the slope of the MdFI of the two detectors (Fig."
"8, dashed line)."
The actual SOV is not a function of the brightness of the positive population but is the same all across the dynamic range.
A truly correct SOV will provide correct compensation whether it is derived from a bright or dim positive population (Fig.
"8, Correct SOV)."
"When calculating a slope, the most accurate measurement (i.e., SOV) is obtained when the two data points obtained are apart as far as possible."
"This is especially important for low spillover values such as PE-Cy7 into PE.Open in a separate windowFigure 8.Brightness of positive population.However, we rarely get “perfect” SOVs, and the impact of any errors in the SOV are magnified as the MdFI of the primary detector increases as shown in Fig."
8.
"In this example, if there is a 1% under compensation error in the SOV (Fig."
"8; red line), it would have a minimal impact on a dim population."
"In this example, in an MdFI of 103 in FL1, the error would be 10 MdFI in FL2, not noticeable."
"However, if the FL1 MdFI is 105, the MdFI error in FL2 would be 1000 and this would incorrectly look like a new positive population.Myth: For spillover to be correct, it is required that the compensation control positive population needs to be as bright as your sample."
"Partly False.To restate the message here, you want to get the most accurate slope/SOV possible."
"Therefore as noted in the title, it is good practice to have the positive control population as bright as possible, preferably close to your sample MdFI (static or activated)."
"However, for spillover to be correct, it is not required that the compensation control positive population needs to be as bright as your sample."
"In some cases, the positive population of compensation beads may not be as bright as your sample."
This does not mean it is not a valid compensation control.
"In general, if the positive population is approximately equivalent to CD4, you will get good results."
There is one major caveat to this statement.
"For all measurements, it is critical that the positive population is in the linear range of the detector."
"Outside of this range, the corrected data will be inaccurate."
"Most cytometer manufacturers provide linearity information for their instruments.Collect enough events to obtain meaningful accurate SOVs.As a rule of thumb, collect at least 5000 events for both your negative and positive population."
"Again this is to ensure the accuracy of the measurements, especially for low SOVs.1.4."
"Compensation controls Compensation controls typically fall into two categories: (i) stained cells; (ii) beads, these are seen as either (i) directly fluorochrome-coated or (ii) anti-Ig capture beads and are available from a number of sources."
Each of these controls has advantages and disadvantages.
"In a given multicolor experiment, compensation controls can be mixed and matched including all three types."
"That is beads (positive and negative) can be used to compensate Fluorochrome A, and cells (positive and negative) to compensate Fluorochrome B."
The key is to follow the second principle and not mix and match different control types within the same single color fluorescent control.1.4.1.
Stained cells The advantage of using stained cells is that these controls most closely replicate what is happening in the assay tube.
The disadvantage is that you may have to use precious biological material.
"In particular, if you need a tandem, lot-specific control for a specific CD marker, splitting the sample to generate such a control decreases the number of cells available for analysis."
This may therefore require the use of even more of the biological sample at the outset.1.4.2.
Beads The advantage of beads is that no biological material is required and they are easy to prepare and use.
"Following the manufacturer's protocols, for many fluorochromes, beads provide sufficiently accurate SOVs."
The disadvantage is that these beads are a surrogate for cells and may not in all cases provide a perfect match to cells.
This can result in discernible and reproducible differences in the SOVs obtained from the exact same reagent measured on beads versus cells.
"Where different SOVs are obtained, the cells must be considered the biologically relevant gold standard.Compensation controls using fluorochrome-coated and anti-Ig capture beads are available from a variety of sources."
"Some are used as stand-alone controls, some are integrated into software packages."
"However, when used for 10–18 color instruments, differences in SOVs can be seen in all of these beads when comparing the SOVs obtained with the beads to the SOVs obtained with the gold standard of cells."
These differences can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.
"For example, the beads from Manufacturer A may be more accurate than the beads from Manufacturer B when calculating the SOV of Fluorochrome X into Y, while the beads from Manufacturer B may be better for calculating the SOV of Fluorochrome Y into Z. SOV differences between beads and cells can be as large as 5–10%.Compensation beads are a powerful tool for making the process of determining SOVs fast and easy and should be used where appropriate."
"However, it is important to use them with reasonable caution."
The best laboratory practice to ensure accurate compensation when using beads is to pretest any new reagent on both beads and cells to ensure that they are providing you with SOVs equivalent to your stained assay samples.
"For example, if you are using a new fluorochrome or a new lot of a tandem, run a quick test staining both cells and beads; calculate the SOVs from both."
If the SOVs are effectively equivalent then you can be comfortable using the beads as controls for all future assays.
"However, if there are significant differences, you may need to use cells as your controls or try a different bead."
"Finally, in such a test, you may want to treat the cells and beads as you would in your assay, e.g., if your assay includes a fix/perm step, you can include this in your control staining."
"Fix/Perm buffers can sometimes, but not always, alter the SOV of your fluorochromes.1.5."
What are “good” SOVs?
This is really a question that cannot be definitively answered.
There is great deal of misunderstanding regarding what SOVs actually mean in terms of a multicolor flow cytometer and the experiments run on them.
"First and foremost, SOVs are empirically determined mathematical values that are used by flow cytometry software to correct for the background due to fluorescence."
"While these values are related to fluorescence spillover, they are not direct absolute measurements of the fluorescence spillover of one fluorochrome into another detector."
"SOVs are based upon median fluorescence measurements, which are gain (i.e., PMT voltage) dependent."
"That means that when you change the PMT voltage on a detector, the SOVs associated with that detector will change."
"However, the actual spillover of fluorescence from one detector into another is unchanged."
So you cannot ask “Why is the SOV on my instrument different than the lab next door?” without knowing the PMT voltages.
The single most important fact to remember is “Changing the PMT voltage on an instrument will change the SOVs but it has absolutely no impact on the actual florescence spillover and its associated spread and does not affect the quality of the data.”1.6.
What is “good enough” accuracy for SOVs?
Using the right compensation controls under the right conditions will maximize the accuracy of your spillover values.
"Still, no matter which controls are used, it is likely that there will be some error in some of the SOV measurements you make."
This brings up the final question of what SOV accuracy is good enough to provide you quality data.
"The honest answer is that “it depends.” It depends upon the design of your assay, the fluorochromes used, and the density of the antigens being analyzed."
Any error in the final data is directly proportional to both the error in the SOV measurement and the brightness (MdFI) of the population being analyzed.
This is demonstrated in Fig.
9.
"In the assay represented in the top panels, the Brilliant Violet™ (BV) 510 positive population is somewhat duller (MdFI ~6000)."
"In this situation, small (±2%) errors in the BV510 into BV605 detector do not significantly affect the error in the MdFI in the BV605 detector (~±100).Open in a separate windowFigure 9.Accuracy for SOV: The figure shows two different assays in which lysed whole blood was stained with the same fluorochromes: BD HorizonTM Brilliant Violet 510 (BV510) and BD HorizonTM Brilliant Violet 605 (BV605)."
Both assays used the same BV605 reagent.
"In the top panels, the BV510 positive population was dim while in the bottom panels the BV510 positive population is very bright."
"For each assay, the SOVs were determined and the correct spillover was applied (Middle panels)."
"For the left panels, the BV510→BV605 SOV was increased by 1% (overcompensated) and compensation applied."
"For the right panels, the BV510→BV605 SOV was decreased by 2% (undercompensated) and compensation applied.The situation in the assay shown in the bottom panels is quite different."
The BV510 positive population is quite bright (MdFI ~68 000).
"Identical errors (i.e., ±2%) in the BV510 → BV605 SOV results in truly BV605 negative populations appearing to be positive (BV605 MdFI errors of ±1300)."
The MdFI error in the spillover detector (here BV605) = the MdFI of the population in the primary detector (BV510) x the %error in the SOV.
"Therefore, an “acceptable” error in the SOV for one assay (e.g., the top panels) may be quite unacceptable for another (the bottom panels)."
"This is again why it is important to pretest your compensation controls to better understand and manage any potential errors that can impact the quality of the final assay.In conclusion, with an understanding of the concepts of compensation/fluorescence spillover and following a simple set of principles when using compensation controls, it should be relatively easy to obtain and present high quality multicolor flow cytometry data.2."
"MaintenanceFlow cytometric experiments produce relative data and they are strictly dependent on the actual context of measurement (e.g., sample quality, reagent quality, or instrument performance)."
"To get comparable results over time, each single step of a flow cytometry experiment needs to be controlled."
This section focuses on the instrument side and discusses important (preventive as well as some reactive) steps in maintaining flow cytometric instruments to ensure a constant quality level of measurement.
"Even if several tips and tricks are mentioned, this section can only offer a basic selection of possibilities and options."
"For some maintenance steps, you need to have additional experience."
"In case of doubt, consult the technical support of the respective company.2.1."
"Introduction The signals generated by flow cytometric instruments are determined by many different factors, such as optical layout (laser and laser power, optical filter), sheath fluid, room climate, and so on."
It is therefore a prerequisite to “know” the performance of the respective system at a certain time point.
"By using appropriate controls and standards, it is possible to define the original status of instrument performance and track it over time."
"This can be performed in different ways and depends upon the type of instrument (analyzer, cell sorter), the instrumental layout (number of lasers, high-throughput system (HTS)) and the type of measurement one wants to conduct (e.g., screening, diagnostic, qualitative vs. quantitative or volumetric tests)."
"Due to an increasing diversity of available flow cytometers on the market, there is no common routine of conducting maintenance and also the time frames and maintenance intervals may vary from one instrument type to the other."
"While most of the manufacturers offer service contracts for their systems, the experienced user can do several things to prevent potential damage and maintain or restore the instrumenťs original level of performance."
"Be aware that for some steps during maintenance (e.g., laser alignment) additional precautions (e.g., wearing laser safety goggles) are necessary to accommodate for an altered hazardous potential (optical (high energy laser), biological, or electrical (high voltage)) compared to normal instrument operation."
Those interventions should only be done by service engineers or specially trained users with the necessary risk assessment and personal protection equipment in place.Maintaining a flow cytometer means retrieving information about the actual status of an instrument and comparing it to the original (ideal) situation.
"It should be ensured that the data have been collected under comparable conditions such as comparable laser warm up time (between 15 and 30 min), fluidic setup (using a primed system and choosing the same flow speed: low, medium, high), and event-rate."
"If the performance check fails, one needs to know how to bring it back to the original level (if possible)."
Below several options detailing how to check the performance of a flow cytometric instrument and what can be done as preventive mainentance procedures are described (summarized in Table 2).Table 2.Summary of options how to check the performance of a flow cytometric instrument and what can be done as a preventive procedureSystemComponentObservation/read outReason/maintenanceFrequency of checkingOpticsLaser/ LED/light sourceMeasured decline of power outputExchange light sourceAs requiredHigh %rCVs (performance test failed)Realign OpticAs requiredWeak or shifting signalsLaser DelayRoutinelyFilter/beam SplitterPerformance failWrong BP-filterAs requiredAgeingSeldomImpaired Scatter or Fluorescence signalsDustFrequentlyPMT/diode/detectorWhen loss of sensitivity is observedSensitivityRoutinelyWeak separation of dim populationsLinearity (define Min.

Maintaining optical devices Maintenance starts with cleaning the instrument.
"To prevent danger from laser radiation or electrical hazards, this can be done without switching on the cytometer."
"For example, it is necessary to remove dust from the ventilation systems to allow effective air-cooling of lasers and power supplies as well as from optical filters (BP, SP, and LP), (dichroic) mirrors, and prisms of the optical path."
Dust will impair the laser-alignment and sensitivity of fluorescence signals by generating additional background and loss of fluorescence signals.
"These parts can be cleaned with unsoiled pressurized air (e.g., as used for electronic parts or computers) and more resistant dust can be carefully removed with cotton swaps or dust free paper wipes (moistened with a drop of pure methanol (e.g., those used in microscopy) as methanol will evaporate without leaving residues on the optics)."
How often these types of preventive maintenance have to be performed strictly depends on the environmental conditions and are sometimes included in maintenance contracts of the vendors.
"Many flow cytometers' lasers are directed via glass fibers to the detection site and, therefore, are relative stable over time in their alignment."
"Other machines are equipped with fixed optical benches, making repetitive laser- and filter-alignment nearly obsolete."
"But in any case, it is important to check (or “know”) the instrument status prior to the measurement.The Cytometer Setup and Tracking (CS&T) module from Becton Dickinson (BD), available since software version DIVA 6.0, is an example, how instrument performance can be monitored over time (BD Cytometer Setup and Tracking Application Guide V3.0, [41])."
The combination of software and the use of standardized beads make possible to retrieve critical parameters in one run.
"After installation through a service engineer or exchange of components (e.g., lasers, filters, or PMTs), the status of the instrument is documented in a so-called “baseline.” A lot of information (not all of it is listed here) about the linear range of each PMT (important for proper measurement and compensation (see Chapter II Section 1.3 Measuring SOVs/compensation controls), electronic noise and background (Br, SDEN), detector efficiency (Qr), as well as sensitivity (Peak ratio between negative and positive population) and quality of laser alignment (%rCV) is stored in this file."
"All the introduced values are summarized in Table 3 with a very brief explanation and are described in much greater detail elsewhere [42–51].Table 3.Summary of some critical parameters defining the optical performance of a flow cytometerParameterA measure for …Recommended ValueSDEN… electronical noiseas low as possible%rCV… Laser alignmentas low as possibleQr… Detector efficiencyas high as possibleBr… the channel backgroundas low as possibleSignal to Noise ratio… sensitivity of Detectoras high as possibleOpen in a separate windowIn a second step, the instrument performance can be tracked and compared to the baseline values by running the same lot of standard-beads at different time points."
The software module is then reporting every observed change.
In Fig.
"10A, a typical result of a CS&T performance check is shown."
A wrong BP filter in front of the PMT-detector resulted in a lower signal.
"As a consequence, the system needed a higher PMT-voltage (ΔV) to reach the defined target value for this particular channel."
The change in ΔV was larger than the accepted range (which is as default value in CS&T ≤ 50 V) and instrument performance failed with notice to the user (red cross).
"On flow cytometers without a CS&T-option, a similar result can be achieved by using nearly any kind of standardized particles (e.g., Rainbow Beads, 6- or 8-Peak Beads, Calibrite®, CS&T Beads [41] or other fluorescent-labeled Beads)."
"Instead of a “baseline,” one has to generate a system-specific calibration containing all the fluorescent channels and parameters including a fluorescence channel of each available laser versus time."
"At already suggested time-points, one is measuring the beads under defined settings and save this result as a (instrument specific) “standard.” Future measurements with the same kind of beads (consider and document potential lot to lot variations over time) and the same instrument settings (see Chapter IV, Section 2.1) will allow a comparison to the first “standard” measurement and monitors changes in instrument performance."
In Fig.
"10B, a result for the same situation as described for the CS&T-option is shown."
"With the correct BP filter (510/50), the beads are falling inside the target values (positive peak of the blue curve is inside the brackets), whereas with a wrong BP filter (610/20), the instrument performance fails (red curve).Open in a separate windowFigure 10.Examples for performance tracking with and without a CS&T module [130]."
(A) A Levey-Jennings chart of a weekly measured performance for one parameter (out of 10) is shown.
"The cross in red indicates a failure in the performance check (a higher PMT-Voltage is needed to reach the target values of the beads, which corresponds to a loss of sensitivity)."
"After checking and changing the band-pass filter in front of the corresponding PMT, the performance is measured again and is compared to the previous situation (blue dots)."
"With the correct band-pass filter installed, the performance of the PMT is back to the previous level."
The graph is taken from a CS&T-Cytometer Performance Report of a BD FAC-SCanto II equipped with 3 lasers.
"(B) The histogram of channel A of the violet 405 nm laser shows the corresponding measurement to the situation described above in (a) and is taken from a self-defined, instrument-specific calibration worksheet."
"The blue population represents the “standard” setup (with a 510/50 band-pass filter in front of the PMT of channel A, where the beads are reaching the respective target values (brackets)."
The red curve shows a measurement with a 610/20 nm band-pass filter instead.
The beads are clearly outside the target values and the positive and negative populations are barely separated from each other.
"This is an example, how one can easily track basic instrument performance without having a separate software module available.Having this kind of information for all parameters at various timepoints (every day or week) will give a good overview of the performance of the system."
Tracking at least one fluorescent channel per laser over time gives additional information about the stream stability and indicates if air bubbles inside the system are causing problems.
"Displaying these plots during an experiment may help to reveal problems with sticky or unfiltered samples.Beside the target channels, also the shape and width of the peaks are of importance and can indicate for instance a laser misalignment."
As shown in Fig.
"11A, the peak of the positive beads is still inside the defined target area, but the width (%rCV) is twice as big as the corresponding measurement during the standard performance (Fig."
11B).
"After realigning the laser, the shape of the peak and the %rCV value are again in the expected range.Open in a separate windowFigure 11.How one can detect suboptimal alignment of lasers."
Both histograms display a negative and positive bead population in the 450/50 channel of the UV-Laser of a BD FAC-SAria SORP cell sorter.
"Although the positive peak in (A) still falls into the defined target area (brackets = P2), the shape and %CV of the peak suggest a suboptimal alignment of the UV-Laser."
After realignment the shape of the positive peak become narrower with only the half of the %CV.
"(B) Laser-alignment is optimal, when the lowest %CV values are reached.The selected examples illustrate, that tracking an instrument performance is possible in different ways (8-Peak Beads, CS&T or fluorescent labeled beads, etc.)"
as long as one knows where to look at and to what instrument specific “standard” an actual result has to be compared to.
"As noted earlier, there are several additional parameters, which can be tracked (e.g., laser delay and area scaling factors), but with a correct standard setup, most of them can be accessed via appropriate bead measurements.2.3."
Maintaining the fluidic system 2.3.1.
Sheath filters The fluidic system of most flow cytometers is assembled with parts that need to be maintained on a regular basis.
One has to ensure that the fluidic lines and filters are free of air bubbles.
Entrapped air compresses differently than sheath fluid and can cause unstable (“dancing”) fluorescence signals due to incorrect time calculation of the incoming signals.
"The more lasers a machine has, the less tolerant the system is against air bubbles or unstable compressed air supply."
Sheath or saline filters therefore have to be vented on a daily basis and replaced every 6 months (most commonly suggested time interval by manufacturers).
"In machines without extra sheath supply (e.g., Guava EasyCyte, Partec/Sysmex, Accuri etc."
"), air in the system will cause false values for volumetric cell counting or will lead to empty fcs-files without any measured event.2.3.2."
"Sheath tanks Sheath tanks, especially when they are pressurized, have to be refilled and checked for leakiness on a frequent basis."
Bal seals have to be replaced before they lose integrity.
The consequences are similar to those described above for entrapped air bubbles.
"An additional consequence in cell sorters is an unstable droplet breakoff point, which is critically dependent on a constant and stable pressure (especially for nozzle sizes above 85 μm, see also Chapter I Section 1.4 Droplet generation of a cell sorter)."
"Degasing Sheath tanks before usage can therefore improve the stability of the droplet formation in cell sorters.To ensure sterile cell sorting, one has to clean/autoclave the sheath tanks on a regular basis."
"This goes in line with cleaning the sample injection port (SIP) and the sample tubing (see Table 2, Fluidics)."
"Some machines offer semi-automated start-up and shutdown protocols, as well as cleaning routines one can run after a defined period of time or on demand [52]."
"In general, there are at least four basic protocols to maintain a fluidic system, depending on the intention of the cleaning:sterilization/decontamination,avoid crystallization for long-term storage (e.g., overnight),unclogging,and bleaching (get rid of cross-contaminating dyes).2.3.3."
"Fluidic lines, SIP, and HTS For long-term storage, such as an overnight shutdown or prior to maintenance through a service engineer, most labs run a decontamination protocol followed by a wash cycle before they switch off the instrument (or hand it over to a service technician)."
The most commonly used solutions to decontaminate a flow cytometer are 1% sodium hypochlorite or 70–80% Ethanol.
But freshly prepared 1% hydrogen peroxide can also be used.
Distilled or deionized water is ideal for washing out the cleaning solution.
"To keep a machine in a “dormant”/unused state for a longer period of time (weeks/month), one could dry the tanks and system tubing completely after the cleaning process or flush all lines and tanks with distilled or deionized water (containing some preserving agents to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination)."
"When possible, a sample tube containing water can be left at the SIP."
"All this is to ensure that no salt crystal formation occurs, which could subsequently cause clogging, even if the SIP or tubing were to dry out.Sticky or clumpy cells, which are either not properly filtered or used at too high a cell concentration, could block the orifice of an instrument."
"In some (mostly pump driven) instruments (e.g., BD Accuri, Merck/Millipore Guava EasyCyte) one can reverse the direction of the fluidics to push the blockage backwards out of the tubing."
"Running a (prewarmed) detergent (e.g., FACSRinse) through the system for several minutes, followed by filtered deionized water or PBS, can help to release the obstraction in clogged SIP and/or sample lines."
"In machines where one can easily access and remove the SIP, sonication (in clean water) of the tubing is also an option (e.g., Guava EasyCyte)."
"As a last option, one could use thin wires to clean the SIP, working like a sweeper cleaning a chimney."
"If an optional HTS or Carousel Module is available, the washing steps are even more important and fluidic parts and tubing should be changed like recommended from the vendor."
"The usage of fluorescent dyes such as PI, DAPI, or Acridine Orange (AO), which are used to stain nucleic acids (e.g., live/dead, cell cycle, or RNA–DNA ratio) makes an additional cleaning step necessary (because the use of AO can cause a lot of trouble, there are different alternatives available for many applications in which AO is used [e.g., lysotracker, Syto® dyes, and Pyronin Y])."
These dyes are often stained in excess to ensure a good staining profile.
"Due to their planar structure, they are sticky and can also adhere to the tubing."
"Therefore, a high likelihood of cross-contaminating samples between different users exists."
"Running a bleaching solution (e.g., 1% sodium hypochlorite) for 5–10 min will prevent this."
"To check for efficient cleaning, run an unstained cell sample and observe in a bivariate plot (fluorescence channel of the dye (e.g., PI) versus time) if background of these cells is increasing over time."
"In that case additional cleaning is necessary.In all situations, one has to be careful with the use of aggressive/corrosive solutions and make sure that they are washed out/replaced by the respective sheath fluid or distilled water and are not left inside the flow cell for an extended period of time (e.g., overnight) [53], as this could damage the tubing and sealing and end up in leakiness of the system.Some flow cytometers (e.g., Accuri C6, Guava Easycyte, Attune Nxt, MACS®Quant, and CyFlow) allow volumetric measurement, which enables counting and direct calculating of the cell number and concentration of a sample."
A prerequisite for accurate cell counting is also an air bubble and particle free (filtered) sheath fluid and intact sample lines.
"Mechanical stress makes it necessary to replace the tubing at appropriate intervals (e.g., a bimonthly change of the peristaltic pump tubing is recommended for the BD Accuri C6 system [54]).2.3.4."
Flow Cell/Cuvette The flow cell is part of the fluidic and optical system of a flow cytometer and is therefore included when performing a cleaning as described above.
"Nevertheless, some instruments (e.g., BD FACSAria cell sorter, BD FACSCanto II) provide separate automated cleaning procedures to improve performance."
"For most instruments (e.g., FACSCalibur, LSRII, and Fortessa), there are also manual cleaning options, which will require separate training.2.4."
"Computer and software Beside the above-described maintenance steps to ensure proper function of a flow cytometer, the computer and software need some attention."
"Defragmentation of the computer's hard drive and backups of the FCS-files should be scheduled in a frequent way (weekly/monthly, depending on the usage)."
"Where the FCS-files are organized in databases, one should take care that the size of the database does not exceed recommended size limits (e.g., ≤45% of available disk space for the BD FACSDiva Software [55])."
This will impair and slow down at a certain time point the performance of the entire system.
"Using the implemented Data Manager software on BD instruments (at least once per month) reduces the size of the database log file and is improving the overall performance and stability of the DIVA software.Although most flow cytometers on the market are very robust and reliable, there are still many things that need to be controlled."
Table 2 summarizes many common steps to consider during instrument maintenance.
"As already mentioned, it depends on the instrument and environmental setup which steps have to be done in which frequency and the focus might vary from laboratory to laboratory."
"Therefore, it is an overview and a suggestion of procedures, which should help to get the best results out of your flow data."
"In any case of doubt, contact the reference guidelines and/or service engineers of your vendor to prevent damage from your system and to keep it in a good condition.3."
PMT voltage optimizationCorrectly setting PMT voltage gains is essential to optimize signals and improve the resolution of dim populations.
"The aim is to bring signal out of the low end of the scale, which is dominated by electronic noise that will obscure dim events, without pushing bright events off the top of the scale.Historically, many cytometry users set voltages by eye, often by placing an unstained population in the first decades of a log scale."
"However, this method is potentially problematic, particularly in channels with inherently low autofluorescence, such as those in the red spectrum."
"Alternatively, while it is possible to set voltages using stained cells on a per experiment basis this is time-consuming, uses valuable samples and lacks reproducibility."
"As a result, standardized methods to optimize voltages are required.Due to their ability to provide consistent signals, fluorescent bead-based methods are an important step in PMT setup."
Several approaches can be used.
"On BD instruments Cytometer setup and tracking (CS&T), an automated bead-based method is available [41]."
"In this case, CS&T beads are used in an automated fashion to obtain an initial baseline voltage optimization based on setting the MdFI of dim beads to 10 times the robust standard deviation of the electronic noise (rSDen), essentially ensuring that electronic noise only contributes 10% or less of the signal."
"This allows setting of reproducible voltages in reference to a bead standard, but does not guarantee that the voltages are optimal for the biological samples being used in a particular experiment.An alternative is a voltage walk approach in which a range of voltages are applied to beads to determine the point at which separation of an unstained and dim bead population is maximal, while also ensuring that the separation of highly stained bead populations is not altered."
The level of separation can be determined via ratios such as M2 (separation of dimmest peak = MFI of the lowest positive peak/90th percentile of the negative bead) and M5 (separation of brightest peak) [48] or via calculation of the stain index [56].
A variant of this approach is the peak 2 method which also applies a voltage walk to a bead set containing a dim population [57].
"This is used to find the point at which the robust CV (rCV) of the second peak, the dimmest positive population, is not reduced by further voltage increases."
The rCV of dim particles directly corresponds to the resolution sensitivity [58].
This point also coincides with the point at which the standard deviation begins to increase (Figure 12).
"A disadvantage here is that the exact point to choose is subjective and differing bead sets may have differing levels of separation of the peak 2 beads, affecting sensitivity.Open in a separate windowFigure 12.Voltage walk displaying rCV and rSD of the second peak of sperotech 8 peak rainbow calibration particles."
"The arrow indicates the point of minimal PMT voltage.While bead-based methods are effective at determining minimal voltage requirements and tracking reproducibility, some further optimization may be required to determine optimal settings for particular biological samples."
"In some cases, it may be found that the minimum voltage determined by beads causes highly stained cells to be off scale or above the linear maximum."
"In this case, it is essential to reduce the voltage in order to obtain reliable results from these cells since data outside the linear range will result in compensation errors."
"If this occurs regularly, switching to a dimmer fluorochrome for the highly stained marker or adjusting staining protocols may be a better solution to preserve resolution of dim populations for this channel."
Another source of variation in optimal PMT voltages is the difference in the level of autofluorescence in a cell population and the calibration beads.
One method to deal with this is to use the BD application settings [59].
"To ensure that electronic noise does not have a major influence on the resolution of dim populations, unstained cells can be run and the PMT gain adjusted until the population has an rSDen of 2.5 times baseline."
This will effectively balance the autofluorescence of the population on the outer edge of the electronic noise meaning that dim signals should be resolvable and define the minimal acceptable voltage.
BD application settings are able to save these cell population optimized values in reference to CS&T baseline values so that they can be automatically adjusted in reference to any ΔPMT between CS&T baseline and CS&T daily performance checks.
"On non-BD instruments, it is also possible to carry out these daily adjustments if the electronic noise of the instrument has been determined by the user or by using a voltage walk approach to define optimal separation distances of measured populations and then saving these values in reference to a corresponding MdFI of a bead population at the same voltage [48].In summary, the goal of PMT voltage optimization is to initially determine the settings with optimal sensitivity and then reproduce them on a daily basis."
It is important to note that the aim is not to reuse the same voltage value but rather to optimize the voltage each time to ensure the same signal.
"While multiple methods are available, most conform to a similar basic structure: 1) initial setup using a control population (normally a bead control) to determine reproducible minimum voltage requirements; 2) validation and if needed, further optimization of settings for relevant biological samples, to be saved in reference to the bead control; and 3) a daily check of the beads controls in order obtain the desired reference values and thus the optimal voltage."
"Importantly, while steps 1 and 2 may be initially time-consuming, baseline settings determined in this way should be robust for an instrument as long as it does not undergo significant configuration changes."
"Once this baseline is set, a relatively brief daily performance check can be used to ensure reproducibility and maintain optimal performance.III."
"Before you start: Reagent and sample preparation, experimental design1."
Controls: Determining positivity by eliminating false positives1.1.
"Introduction For antibodies, the desired way of binding is the specific binding of the antibody, i.e., via its antigen-binding site, to its antigen."
"However, antibodies can bind in another manner to cells, also deemed as “specific,” by interaction with that cell's endogenous Fc receptors."
"A third possible interaction between antibodies and antigens is “nonspecific,” and occurs through ionic and hydrophobic interactions between the two molecules (“stickiness”)."
It is of critical importance to exclude the latter two to be able to reliably quantify antigen expression by immunofluorescence.
"Therefore, proper controls are essential in flow cytometry to determine background fluorescence and/or background staining, to distinguish false positivity from true staining and to quantitate “true” positivity as such."
"Antibodies, the most widely used staining reagents in flow cytometry, can bind a cell in many different manners.1.2."
"Fluorescence spreading into the channel of interest: Fluorescence minus one controls The first step in establishing what a positive signal should look like is to obtain a reference for the natural or background levels, autofluorescence, in that particular detection channel."
"For this purpose, a sample without the staining of interest should be acquired."
"In the case of multiparameter staining, this should be the fluorescence minus one (FMO) control."
"In the FMO control, all antibody conjugates in the experiment are included except the one that is controlled for."
"The FMO control provides a measure of the spread of fluorescence from the other staining parameters into the channel of interest, and is required to accurately determine the threshold for positive staining [60]."
"It does not, however, provide any measure of nonspecific binding.1.3."
"Specificity of reagent for staining target: Biological controls There are several methods to control for the specificity of antibody-mediated immunofluorescent staining, each of which confers varying degree of confidence."
"The most reliable, but often also the most difficult to obtain, control is a negative control consisting of cells that do not express the marker of interest."
"The negative control should be as similar as possible to the experimental sample to exclude differences due to autofluorescence, size, “stickiness,” and so on."
"Such a negative control could be represented by using cell lines that do not usually express the marker of interest, and comparing these against cell lines engineered for ectopic overexpression of the marker, or by comparison to cells genetically deficient for the marker of interest, both of which provide excellent controls for establishing staining protocols and for testing staining specificity."
"Depending on the nature of the marker of interest, the comparison to activated versus non-activated cells may be suitable if markers dependent on activation are analyzed, although one has to consider that activation may also change properties of the cell, such as its size and shape, which may also increase the inherent autofluorescence or unspecific staining."
"The use of internal controls, by staining additional markers to identify cells not expressing the marker of interest within the same sample, e.g., using CD8+ T cells as a negative control for CD4+ T-cell-specific markers, or CD19+ B cells when examining CD3+ T cell-specific markers, should also be considered.1.4."
"Specificity of reagent for staining target: Blocking and isotype controls In cases where biological negative controls are not available or difficult to come by, blocking controls can also provide an excellent measure of unspecific binding."
"Specific binding is blockable, i.e., loss of staining by the fluorescently labeled antibody after the addition of either excess soluble antigen or unlabeled antibody, both of which block the specific interaction of the staining antibody with its cognate antigen."
Unlabeled blocking antibody must recognize the same antigenic epitope with comparable affinity of the labeled antibody whose specificity has to be verified.
Ideally the same antibody clone should be used.
Any positive signals still detected despite the use of blocking controls indicate that unspecific binding due to ionic and hydrophobic interactions of the antibody or the fluorochrome has occurred.
"When using these controls, however, one has to be aware that blocking controls do not exclude cross-reactivity of the staining antibody to other antigens."
"Normal human serum (10% in PBS with an optional addition of 0.5% BSA) can be used to block the binding of labeled antibodies to FcγR when human cells (particularly B cells or myeloid cells, i.e., monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages) are analyzed.Probably the most widely used staining control, the isotype control, is of limited use in determining the threshold of positivity/level of background fluorescence due to unspecific binding."
The rationale behind using isotype controls is the assumption that unspecific staining is due to the isotype of the antibody.
"As a matter of fact, positive staining with isotype controls may be an indication that antibodies bind via Fc receptors to the cell."
"In that case, Fc receptor blocking reagents should be used to prevent such an interaction [61]."
"However, isotype controls are by nature different reagents than the staining antibody, with a different amino acid composition in the variable region, different numbers of fluorochromes bound to the antibody, and different concentrations, and, thus, have different “unspecific” binding properties."
"Therefore, a negative staining with the isotype control does not infer that the staining one observes with the experimental antibody is specific.2."
"Titration: Determining optimal reagent concentrationBefore any experiment, it is good practice to validate and optimize the reagents used."
"In flow cytometry, these reagents are generally specific antibodies used to detect and quantify proteins on single cells."
"Using too much or too little of the staining reagent will result in increased unspecific staining, decreased SNR, decreased sensitivity, lack of linearity between level of expression and staining intensity, and increased experimental costs."
"Thus, it cannot be stressed enough that determining the optimal concentration of antibodies for your experiment is of utmost importance."
"The optimal concentration or “titer” of an antibody or any other staining reagent has to be determined empirically for target and your staining condition (i.e., staining time and temperature), and for every new batch of staining reagent for that matter."
"Live cells may have a different staining optimum than fixed cells, proteins stained on the cell surface different than the same protein stained intracellularly."
"As it is very improbable that commercial reagents have been tested on your particular experimental conditions, they should also always be titrated rather than being used at the manufacturer's recommended titer or concentration.To determine the optimal titer for the staining antibody it is recommended to make a serial dilution of the antibody."
"If it is not known from which concentration to start from, a generic starting point is 10 μg/mL of antibody, which is then serially diluted 1:2 for six to eight dilution steps."
The number of cells used for the titration should be orientated toward the number of cells being stained in the actual experiment.
"However, while the number of cells affects the staining quality, staining tends to be quite robust within quite a large density range, e.g., 105−5 × 106 cells."
"Once titrated, an antibody concentration generally gives comparable staining quality within a ten- to 50-fold range of cell concentrations."
"If cell concentrations are increased by more than that, it is usually sufficient to increase antibody concentrations by two- to threefold, or to make a quick two to three step titration.Once a titration series has been made, there are several ways to evaluate the data to determine the optimal titer."
"The simplest method is to calculate the ratio of the MFI of the positive population (stained by the CD4 mAb) to the MFI of the negative population, i.e., the SNR (Fig."
13A and ​andB).B).
It should be taken into consideration that the applied gates for the negative and positive population will have to be adjusted for each sample in the titration series.
The titer for the best separation will be the one with the highest SNR (Fig.
"13B), i.e., in this case 0.68 μg/mL or a 1:800 dilution of the original antibody stock.Open in a separate windowFigure 13.Titration of a CD4 mAb (clone GK1.5) conjugated to FITC and titrated on murine splenocytes."
The antibody was titrated in 1:2 dilution steps starting from a 1:100 dilution (5.4 μg/mL) up to 1:12 800 (0.04 μg/mL).
(A) Histograms of the stained samples are shown.
(B) MFI of the positive and negative populations (left axis) and SNR between the positive and negative populations (right axis) are plotted.
Best separating titer for this particular antibody was determined to be 0.7 μg/mL (1:800 dilution).One can also consider the lowest antibody concentration that gives near maximum signal.
"This will be the concentration at which staining is saturating and most robust toward changes in cell number, staining time, and temperature."
"Other methods to assess optimal staining by determining the staining index are described here [62]:Additional aspects to consider areWhen using antibodies, it is the concentration of the antibody which is the critical parameter, i.e., when upscaling an experiment to stain in a bigger volume, increase the amount of antibody correspondingly to keep the concentration the same.When titrating an antibody, make sure you have a population that does not express the antigen of interest; this helps to correctly assess background staining."
"If there are no “negative” cells in the population, consider spiking in cells.Once an optimal titer has been determined, indicate the concentration of the staining antibody for optimal staining, and not the dilution factor, when it comes to publishing your results.If possible, use counterstains to identify subsets of cells that coexpress or do not coexpress the marker you are titrating for."
This will help determine/confirm the specificity of the titrated antibody.3.
Preparation of single-cell suspensions3.1.
Introduction The fluidic nature of counting in flow cytometry requires single-cell suspensions.
"If cells from either solid tissue or an adherent cell culture have to be analyzed, a disintegration of the tissue or the cell layer into single cells is an absolute prerequisite for any flow analysis.Techniques for the disaggregation of tissue into single cells are very old with most of the basic protocols being from the 1980s or 1990s."
"Since flow cytometry was first developed, it has always been of great importance to measure cells not only from a suspension culture but also from adherent cell cultures or from solid tissue."
"In particular, in tumor research, disaggregation of the tissue has to be done carefully for the application of flow cytometry."
"Nonetheless, despite all the protocols and even some automatic disaggregation systems, disaggregation is still a process that has to be optimized specifically for each tissue in order to get the best possible results."
A high degree of standardization can be maintained in the cytometric laboratory using automatic processing machines from industrial companies.
"For non-automated protocols, companies provide a large variety of special enzymes and protocols for enzymatic digestion.The protocol for cell preparation depends strongly on the cellular properties that are under study."
"These staining targets could either be markers on the cell surface, in the cell plasma, or in the nucleus."
"Alternatively, it could be DNA or RNA extracted from each cell after cell sorting.With similar techniques, subcellular components such as nuclei, chromosomes, and mitochondria can be extracted either directly from the tissue or after disintegration.The two main principles for dissociation of a tissue or an adherent cell culture into single cells are mechanical or enzymatic dissociation; however, the effect of the enzymes on each protein of interest needs to be determined, e.g., some cell surface proteins are cleaved by collagenase."
"Also note, just as a reminder, if unknown clinical material is to be analyzed, biological safety regulations have to be maintained.3.2."
"Mechanical disintegration From a tissue (e.g., solid tumors), a sufficient number of cells have to be extracted by applying mechanical forces."
The tissue is generally placed into a Petri dish containing some growth medium and held by forceps.
"Using a scalpel, the tissue is then scraped and minced, as long as it takes until cells are released."
The solution is then filtered to remove large tissue pieces and very gently centrifuged.
The resulting pellet is resuspended in growth medium afterward.3.3.
"Enzymatic digestion For enzymatic digestion, very often trypsin and collagenase Type II are used."
"In addition, other commonly used enzymes include papain, elastase, pronase, hyaluronidase, and Dispase®."
"If the degree of ploidy has to be determined, as in the case of tissue from solid tumors, DNase I should be added to the cocktail to remove DNA from non-intact cells."
"The tissue is incubated in the enzyme solution, usually at 37°C for some time."
This is followed by removing the enzymatic cocktail by centrifugation and resuspending the cells in medium.It is advised after dissociation by either mechanical or enzymatic methods to determine the number of cells and their viability.
"An easy way of determining viability is to use a dye exclusion test with the classical Trypan blue test in a hemocytometer by visual microscopic inspection being the “gold standard.” Use of either this test, or other dye exclusion tests with fluorescing dyes that can be assessed by flow cytometry are helpful to perform."
"Further information on establishing/controlling for viability is covered later in this article (Section III.4 Dead cell exclusion, cell viability, and sample freezing)."
"After viability has been established, the cell suspension can be used directly for flow cytometric analysis or stored after fixation or freezing for later measurement.In many published protocols, both mechanical and enzymatic methods of generating single-cell suspensions from original material are commonly combined and modified appropriately to give the best results in term of cell yield, cell viability, and integrity of aneuploid populations."
"A good representation of all kinds of cells in the sample after tissue dissociation is always aimed for; however, it can never be taken for granted that it is 100% and that the proportion of different cell types in the final sample resembles exactly their proportions in the tissue."
"Furthermore, the physiological state of the generated cell suspension may be different from that in the starting material.3.4."
Special disaggregation techniques Two special disaggregation techniques deserve a mention and these are nuclei from paraffin-embedded tissue and nuclei and chromosome isolation.3.4.1.
Nuclei from paraffin-embedded tissue The preparation of samples from paraffin-embedded sections for flow cytometry requires a different protocol from those described above.
"In clinical research, the flow cytometric analysis of cells from a paraffin-embedded section can be required, especially if backward screening of patients needs to be performed."
Preparations of cell nuclei from paraffin sections are possible.
"In principle, a section cut from the paraffin block has to be dewaxed using a solvent such as xylene, followed by treatment with ethanol and water for rehydration."
"However, this can be a very lengthy procedure."
"Thereafter, DNA staining of the isolated nuclei with intercalating dyes can give reasonably good DNA histograms.3.4.2."
Nuclei and chromosome isolation Pure cell nuclei and/or micronuclei can be isolated directly from most tissues and the protocols used for nuclei preparation for cells in suspension can be adopted.
Excellent results from adherent cell cultures are possible even without using trypsination.
The tissue is first treated with salt solutions containing a detergent and RNase.
This is followed by treatment with an acidic sucrose solution.
"In this way, the cytoplasm is destroyed and nuclei are released [63]."
"In a very similar way, whole chromosomes can be isolated from metaphase cells and their DNA content can be measured with high precision."
Even single chromosomes can be sorted based on their difference in DNA content.3.5.
"Ensuring a single-cell suspension/removing oversized aggregates after extraction For all disaggregation methods described, it is essential to ensure a single-cell suspension and to remove oversized aggregates after extraction."
"To do so, the suspensions should be filtered through a simple mesh (~30 to 50 μm) or a cell strainer to remove larger aggregates, which otherwise can clog the flow cytometer's nozzle or channel.3.6."
"General comments Once a protocol for a certain cell type and experiment has been developed, it is strongly recommended to always proceed in a highly standardized way."
Automatic systems with high reproducibility provide mechanical as well as enzymatic tissue disaggregation in a more or less automatic process and may be advantageous in the routine cytometric laboratory.
"For a typical solid tissue, the cell yield is about 107 cells/mg material and it should be possible to achieve >50% viability in the isolated cells."
"What should not be underestimated, however, is the probability of perturbing cell surface structures and epitopes or disrupting the cell, which could occur in solid tissue disaggregation."
"In some cases, cell clumping, dramatically reducing the cellular yield, can be a big obstacle for a productive flow analysis.Many protocols for tissue dissociation and cell isolation use a combination of the above procedures as one technique on its own may not deliver a high cell yield and cell viability."
Alternative methods such as aspiration may also be used [64].
A successful protocol depends in general on the personal experience in the laboratory.
"It is also highly dependent on the amount of available tissue(s), the nature of the tissue, and the planned use of the material.4."
"Dead cell exclusion, cell viability, and sample freezing4.1."
Exclude dead cells The cell type and the isolation procedure from dissociated tissues or liquid samples will influence cellular integrity and viability.
"In principle, dead cells will increase background signals either caused by a general increase in autofluorescence or by an increased behavior to bind antibodies in a low-affinity and unspecific manner."
"Therefore, dead cells should be labeled by high affinity DNA stains such as PI, DAPI, or 7- ADD (7-aminoactinomycin D), so that they can be excluded by appropriate gating from further analysis (see live/dead discrimination see Section III.4 and Section V.2)."
"In general, fluorochromes for discrimination of living and dead cells can be differentiated between those that passively integrate in the DNA of plasma membrane-permeable dead cells or those that were actively transported into living cells only."
"However, these probes are not applicable for intracellular analyses, since all cells have to be fixed and permeabilized before staining."
"For these purposes, fixable dead cell stains are available that bind to amines of proteins."
"These probes are available in a wide range of different fluorescence colors, and samples are to be stained first before applying the fixation and permeabilization protocol."
An extensive overview of life/dead cell discrimination based on dye exclusion can be found in ref.
[65].4.2.
DNA-binding dyes The principle of identifying dead cells using DNA binding dyes is based on the concept that these dyes are impermeable to the plasma membrane and so cannot enter viable cells having intact membranes.
Viable cells will exclude these dyes and therefore exhibit little to no fluorescence.
Cell viability can therefore be assessed by incubating samples with a DNA dye such as PI or 7-AAD; dead cells will stain positively for either of these two nuclear dyes.
"It is important to be aware that dyes such as PI and 7-AAD can be taken up into viable cells over time, and so these stains should be added immediately (~10 min) prior to analysis, and the staining protocol should be standardized across the experiments."
"It is also important to note that DNA binding dyes cannot be used on fixed or permeabilized cells such as those that would be used in studies interrogating the expression of intracellular “targets” using intracellular flow cytometry.For the analysis, a data acquisition region is placed around the positively stained cells, and color-eventing or “back gating” on the PI+ or 7-AAD+ cells present is used to identify most, but not all, dead cells as exhibiting lower FSC and higher SSC than viable cells."
"Although it is possible to gate around the viable cell population on the basis of their light scatter profile and use this for all subsequent samples, even if these samples do not include a viability indicator, by far the best method for excluding dead cells from data analysis is to use a vital DNA dye in all samples."
"Although common dyes used in multicolor analyses include PI, 7-AAD, TOPRO-3, pyronin Y(G) (PY(G)), and SYTOX, a plethora of options are now available from a range of commercial suppliers."
"A note of caution is that the broad emission spectrum of 7-AAD (600–750 nm at 20% normalized emission maximum) can result in a significant level of spectral overlap into other detectors and exclude its use in the context of other fluorochromes such as PE-Cy5, PerCP, and PerCP-Cy5.5 in large multi-parameter panels."
"Furthermore, it is quite a “dim” (low quantum efficiency) fluorescent molecule when compared to PI, which is very “bright.” However, the minimal spectral overlap between 7-AAD emission and that of fluorochromes such as FITC and PE can be useful in some instances."
"One will also need a compensation control for these dyes, and this could be generated by staining cells that have been heat treated (70°C, 30 min), or by leaving cells in isotonic saline without nutrition overnight.Although these approaches use one of the fluorescent detection channels and thereby reduce the number of other parameters that can be interrogated, the issue of viability is an important one and the integrity of the experimental data and their interpretation should not be compromised by not including a viability stain in all experiments."
"The far-red viability dye DRAQ7TM (Biostatus Ltd., UK) is another viability dye that can be used in similar settings to PI and 7-AAD and allows the identification or exclusion of apoptotic, damaged, or dead cells."
"A particularly useful feature of DRAQ7TM is that its dual excitation using blue (488 nm) and red (633/638 nm) lasers and its emission at 650–800 nm allows multibeam excitation and the exclusion of dead (DRAQ7+) cells without “consuming” what could be a vital, and much needed, additional fluorescent channel [66, 67]."
"The advantages of the classical DNA-binding dyes are that this is a well-established approach that involves a short incubation at the end of the staining procedure, and that the reagents are of low cost."
"However, they are limited in their spectral (excitation, emission) characteristics and a significant disadvantage is that they are not suitable for experiments that are interrogating intracellular expression of relevant antigens that require fixation and permeabilization."
"A typical staining protocol involves the following:Add 500 μL of cell suspension (1−2 × 106 cells—unfixed) to a 12 × 75 mm polystyrene tube.Add nuclear staining compound dissolved in PBS [PI: 5 μL, 200 μg/mL, 7-AAD: 4 μL, 250 μg/mL, TO-PRO-3: 4 μL, 250 μg/mL, or PY(G): 5 μL, 200 μg/mL] to tube.Incubate cells on ice for at least 5 min.Analyze cells by flow cytometry.4.3."
"Protein-binding dyes In some instances, the aim of the analysis will be to determine and compare the expression of intracellular molecules/proteins, in which case cells must be fixed and permeabilized in order to allow the probes and antibodies to enter the cells."
The use of DNA binding dyes is inappropriate in these circumstances.
"In these instances, the use of dyes binding to the amine groups of proteins (amine-binding dyes), not DNA, is recommended.The identification of nonviable cells under such circumstances can be achieved using products having varied fluorescence spectral properties such as the LIVE/DEADR fixable range of products from Life Technologies, the eFluor™ fixable dyes from eBioscience, BioLegend’s Zombie range of fixable dyes, Tonbo biosciences' Ghost Dyes™, and the Fixation and Dead Cell Discrimination Kit from Miltenyi Biotec."
These dyes covalently react with protein so that the discrimination is completely preserved following fixation of the sample.
It should be noted that these dyes are membrane impermeable and so will be internalized only by nonviable cells.
"However, the level of fluorescence emitted by viable cells (with which the dye has had access to only a few amines on the cell surface), and nonviable cells (in which the dye has had access to many more amines intracellularly) will be clearly distinguishable."
"A word of caution: it is crucial to ensure that staining protocols are performed in the absence of proteins in the staining buffer, to which the dye will bind."
Experiments can be compensated using commercial amine-reactive beads or labeled and unlabeled cells.4.4.
Vital dyes A third category of reagent that can be used for determining cell viability and cell death are the vital dyes.
These dyes indicate viability by emitting fluorescence in response to metabolic activity in cells.
Cellular esterases cleave the acetomethoxy group to yield calcein inside metabolically active cells.
“Free” calcein binds intracellular calcium and fluoresces brightly green.
Calcein AM dyes can be passively loaded into adherent and non-adherent cells.
"These cell-permeable esterase substrates serve as viability probes that measure both enzymatic activity, which is required to activate their fluorescence, and cell membrane integrity, which is required for intracellular retention of their fluorescent products."
"Available with blue, violet, and green fluorescence, these dyes are ideal for short-term staining (signals can be measured within 5 min, but once the AM group is cleaved, it can be actively transported out of the cell within a few hours) of live cells and can be used in multiplexed flow cytometry experiments."
"However, as the fluorescence generated by these dyes is driven by the presence of metabolic activity, it is not easy to include them in staining protocols that require fixation and permeabilization.4.5."
"Dye-free approaches As a sub-optimal alternative to the use of fluorescent stains, the light scatter properties of dying cells and cells undergoing apoptosis change and these can be detected by flow cytometry based on forward and side light scatter (FSc, SSc) properties."
"However, the nature of these changes and their detection will depend on the cells and the optical design of the instrument being used."
Apoptotic or dying cells can therefore be identified without any staining by FSC and SSC parameters only.
Reardon et al.
[68] have extensively compared the use of light scatter- and fluorescence-based approaches for monitoring viability after freezing.
"Cells can also be stained for apoptotic markers (e.g., cleaved caspase-3 or cleaved- PARP)."
"This works well for cells that are directly collected from growth culture or in vivo, as cells in these situations commonly die by apoptosis."
"These markers will not work for cells that die by necrosis, but such cells are more likely to have abnormal scatter.4.6."
Freezing cell samples The freezing of cell samples offers the advantage of being able to monitor responses over a prolonged period and to manage longitudinal studies involving many patients and/or healthy donors/controls.
Freezing of cells is also used when including samples taken at multiple sites and having them analyzed at a central laboratory.
"Freezing, therefore, facilitates the logistics of measurement, such as when only a few samples per day are to be analyzed and the simultaneous analysis of samples that have been collected at different times reduces the potential impact of experimental and analytical variabilities that can be introduced."
"Of course, all of these should be minimized by establishing standard operating procedures for the experimental set up and flow cytometric analyses and undertaking robust and regular quality control processes for the instrument.However, even if precautions are taken, freezing cells inevitably influences cellular biology and key parameters that are likely to be a key element of the study such as viability, immunological capacity and responsiveness, and ability to be expanded in vitro."
The properties of thawed cells might be significantly different to their freshly isolated counterparts.
These potential issues and limitations therefore need to be taken into consideration.
"Whenever possible, one should determine the effect of freezing and thawing on the key biological and immunological readouts before embarking on an experimental program that stores frozen samples.Maintaining the highest level of viability requires cells to be frozen in a cryoprotective solution."
"DMSO is a commonly used solution that, when used at a concentration between 5 and 10% v/v in an appropriate medium, retains a high level of viability after storage."
"One technical point to consider is that the best recovery is achieved with a gradual freezing process, i.e., lowering the temperature of the cells by 1 to 2°C/min."
This procedure is intentionally slow in order to prevent the formation of ice crystals and cell rupture.
"Higher concentrations of DMSO (up to 10% v/v) allows faster freezing and has been shown to deliver 85% post-thaw viability, with some variability between different types of leukemia."
Automatic freezing techniques using temperature-controlled setups have been developed for the routine cytometry laboratory.
"In these systems, the cell samples are slowly moved down a tank of liquid nitrogen by a motor-driven spindle."
Commercially available cell freezers are the most suitable appliances for this process.
"However, manual methods have been widely reported to give adequate results.The thawing process is as important as the freezing one and must be done very rapidly, with active thawing being preferential to a passive one."
Active thawing and other steps in the thawing process have been evaluated for leukocytes by Hønge et al.
[69].
"It should be appreciated that different cell types respond differently to thawing, and this needs to be taken into consideration during experimental design."
"As an example, Alsayed et al."
[70] reported that myeloid leukemia cells recovered better than lymphoid leukemia cells.
Immunophenotyping is an important and frequently used method in risk assessment and posttherapy follow-up in the clinical laboratory that requires a high degree of standardization and post-thaw viability tests in order to ensure that results are accurate and robust.It is also possible to fix live cells and then freeze them.
"This is not appropriate for any setting where the cells need to be analyzed for function after thawing, if the main issue is one of logistics, fixing, and then freezing works well."
"One can use the Smart Tube System (Smart Tube Inc), or the fixing protocol published by Chow et al."
[71].5.
Cell fixation and permeabilization for flow cytometric analyses5.1.
"Introduction The analysis of intracellular targets using flow cytometry (intracellular cytometry) presents a number of technical challenges that are not generally encountered in the measurement of cell surface epitopes, or in the measurement of dye uptake/processing (e.g., Calcein AM) in viable cells."
"In general, cells (in suspension) must be first “fixed” to preserve and maintain both the structure and location of target epitopes, then “permeabilized” to allow probe (e.g., antibodies) access—ideally to all cellular compartments (cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosomes, nucleus, etc."
").In general, cell fixation is accomplished by the use of either crosslinking fixatives (e.g., formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde), or low molecular weight alcohols (methanol, ethanol), which generally act to “coagulate” proteins."
Formaldehyde has the advantage of generally maintaining the overall conformation of the native protein.
"However, since formaldehyde generates multiple reactive sites on peptides, polysaccharides, and lipids, crosslinking can hide or sequester epitopes such that they are not freely accessible to antibody probes after fixation."
"An additional benefit of formaldehyde fixation in the study of posttranslational protein modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, etc.)"
"is that formaldehyde appears to both “fix” the modification of target amino acids (serine, threonine, tyrosine), and also inhibits the degradation of these targets in living cells (e.g., phosphatase removal of phosphorylations, demethylase removal of methylations, and so on)."
"In contrast, alcohol fixation generally results in poor detection of some (phospho-, and potentially other protein) modifications.5.2."
"Fixation of whole blood specimens Studies in the field of immunology frequently utilize peripheral blood, lymph node, or bone marrow cells, often with a preliminary purification step (Ficoll–Hypaque, hypotonic lysis, ammonium chloride) to remove red blood cells."
"In addition, preliminary purification techniques can remove potential target cell populations (e.g., loss of blasts using Ficoll–Hypaque)."
"In this section, we will first cover fixation and permeabilization techniques for samples containing red blood cells, and subsequently cover fixation and permeabilization techniques for isolated cell populations (tissue culture cells, isolated lymphocytes, monocytes, etc."
")Following fixation, cell permeabilization is performed in order to gain access to the cell interior."
"This can be accomplished using either detergents (e.g., Triton X-100, NP-40) or saponifiers (e.g., Saponin), or with low molecular weight alcohols (methanol or ethanol)."
"A complete discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches/reagents is beyond the scope of this guideline, but also see Chapter V section 15."
"Here, we focus on a fixation and permeabilization technique developed for use with clinical samples (whole blood, bone marrow) [71]."
"We set out to develop a technique that would allow the direct addition of fixative to clinical samples (to immediately “fix” phospho-epitopes and prevent dissociation of signaling inhibitors out of cells, which can result in rapid reversal of their inhibition)."
"However, the addition of fixative directly to whole blood presented the problem of how to remove RBCs after fixation."
We discovered that the addition of Triton X-100 at the appropriate concentration and time directly to the sample (still containing formaldehyde) achieved RBC lysis and WBC fixation without any significant loss of WBC populations.
"As a cautionary note, it is important that the incubation times are strictly followed.As shown in Fig."
"14, whole blood from a healthy human fixed using the formaldehyde/Triton X-100 technique shows three major populations using FSC versus SSC (lower panel)."
"Here, the location of the monocyte population (blue) is determined using CD14."
"The separation of lymphocytes from monocytes by light scatter alone is sufficient to identify both populations; and as shown in the figure, the use of CD14 provides a good resolution of these cell types."
"The resolution of lymphocytes from cellular debris using light scatter alone, however, is problematic."
The lysis of RBCs generates a significant amount of debris that overlaps with lymphocytes in light scatter measurement.
"However, as shown in Fig."
"14 (top panel), staining the sample with CD45 allows clear resolution of CD45-positive/negative lymphocytes from CD45-positive/negative debris."
The data shown here were generated after a single wash following the RBC lysis step.
Use of additional washes at this point reduces debris significantly for most samples.Open in a separate windowFigure 14.Human whole blood fixed with formaldehyde and permeabilized with TX-100.
White blood cell populations were identified using CD14-PE-Cy7 and CD45-Krome Orange.
Debris (red) is identified using CD45 versus SS (top panel—region C).
Identification of peripheral blood monocytes (shown in blue in both panels) was accomplished using CD-14-PE-Cy7 (not shown).5.3.
Materials 5.3.1.
"Staining whole human blood Fresh human whole blood (5–10 mL) collected in anticoagulant (K2EDTA or sodium heparin).Formaldehyde, 10% (methanol-free)."
Store at room temperature in the dark.
"Use within 6 months.Triton X-100 detergent (e.g., Surfact-Amps™ X-100, Thermo Fisher)."
Prepare working solution by diluting 116 μL 10% aqueous Triton X-100 solution with 10 mL 1× PBS.
Store stock and working solutions at room temperature.
"Working solution is stable for 1 month.PBS, calcium- and magnesium-free, pH 7.4.Wash buffer—PBS/5% BSA (preferably protease-free BSA if also using for antibody dilutions).Methanol—100% reagent grade, dilute to 50 or 80% with NaCl (final concentration 0.9%), store at −20°C; use at 4°C).5.3.2."
"Procedure: Whole blood fixation and permeabilization Place anti-coagulated whole blood sample at 37°C and allow temperature to equilibrate.For 100 μL whole blood sample, add 65 μL 10% formaldehyde, and immediately vortex."
"Incubate at room temperature (~24°C) for exactly 10 min.After exactly 10 min of incubation in formaldehyde at room temperature, add 1 mL of room temperature Triton working solution, vortex, and place in 37°C bath and set timer for 15 min.Add 1 mL of cold (4°C) wash buffer and vortex."
"Centrifuge at 500 × g for 4 min.Inspect tube for complete RBC lysis (rust red pellet, clear red supernatant—not turbid)."
"If RBC lysis is incomplete, resuspend pellet in 1 mL Triton working solution at 37°C for an additional 15 min.Remove supernatant, and wash pellet thrice using cold wash buffer (centrifuge at 500 × g).For methanol treatment, slowly add 1 mL 4°C methanol solution (50 or 80% depending on target epitope) to the washed cell pellet while vortexing pellet."
"Incubate in ice for 10 min.Centrifuge (500 × g) and wash pellet twice using 2 mL cold wash buffer.After final centrifugation, carefully remove as much supernatant fluid as possible."
Resuspend pellet by vortexing.
"Add antibody cocktail, incubate and wash twice with cold wash buffer.Resuspend cell pellet in 0.5 mL wash buffer and analyze immediately on flow cytometer."
"For intracellular epitopes that degrade, or for samples that need to be analyzed more than 6 h after resuspension, resuspend in 0.1% paraformaldehyde in PBS."
Store at 4°C in the dark until analysis.5.4.
Effect of methanol on epitope staining Some intracellular or intranuclear epitopes remain poorly accessible to antibody probes after fixation and permeabilization using the formaldehyde–Triton technique described above.
This is likely a limitation of all similar aldehyde–detergent (only) fixation and permeabilization techniques.
"In our experience, phospho-STAT proteins are largely undetected after this type of processing."
"However, treatment of the fixed and permeabilized cells with cold (4°C) methanol for 5–10 min “unmasks” these epitopes [71], although care must be taken to validate the effects of methanol treatment particularly when used post-staining and when using tandem dyes as described below."
As shown in Fig.
"15, treatment of fixed and permeabilized whole blood (activated using GM-CSF) with up to 50% cold methanol has minimal impact on the quality of P-STAT5 staining (same signal intensity for 50% methanol or untreated sample indicating almost no P-STAT5 staining, not shown)."
"However, treatment with 80% cold methanol produces a significantly stronger P-STAT5 signal."
The impact of treatment with methanol at both 50% (top) and 80% (bottom) concentrations on P-ERK and P-S6 staining (ribosomal S6 protein) is also shown in Fig.
15.
"Here, methanol treatment has minimal effect on the P-ERK signal intensity and reduces the P-S6 signal by about 20%."
"It is therefore important, when first developing and optimizing fixation and permeabilization for new cytoplasmic epitopes, to determine the impact of methanol treatment on all target epitopes that will be measured in the assay.Open in a separate windowFigure 15.Impact of methanol concentration on P-STAT5 immunoreactivity in peripheral blood monocytes activated in vitro using GM-CSF."
Whole blood from a normal donor was treated with GM-CSF for up to 20 min in vitro at 37°C.
One part of the fixed and permeabilized samples was treated with 50% methanol (A) and the other with 80% methanol (B) at 4°C.
"After washing, all samples were stained with (-◊-) P-STAT5, (-□-) P-ERK, and (-Δ-) P-S6.While methanol “unmasking” is important for the evaluation of some phospho-epitopes, it also has the effect of decreasing (or eliminating) the immunoreactivity of other important epitopes used to detect specific cell populations."
"In our experience, this is of particular importance in the analysis of some myeloid–monocyte markers in human blood or bone marrow (CD14, CD33, CD64), and of less importance for stem-cell or progenitor cell markers (CD34, CD117)."
See ref.
"[72, 73] for details regarding cell surface CD markers that we have tested, which are effected by methanol treatment.In the example illustrated in Fig."
"16, we have compared the signal strength obtained when staining whole blood CD14-positive monocytes using either 50 or 80% cold methanol."
"In addition, in this study, cell surface CD14 was stained with a tandem dye (PE-Cy7) either before fixation and permeabilization (and prior to cold methanol treatment), or after fixation, permeabilization, and cold methanol treatment."
"Looking at the impact of 50% methanol treatment (upper panels), comparing the CD14 fluorescence intensity for monocytes labeled before or after fix-perm and methanol, the MFIs are very similar for cells labeled before or after fixation and subsequent treatment."
"In contrast, when considering the impact of pre- or post-fixation staining as shown in the lower panels, cells labeled with CD14 after fix-perm and 80% methanol (lower right panel) show a significant reduction in CD14 staining intensity (compared with that of cells stained after 50% cold methanol, top right)."
"While cells stained with CD14 mAb before fix-perm and 80% cold methanol treatment (bottom left) show a fourfold higher MFI than cells stained after, they still show a 50–60% loss in CD14 staining intensity (relative to unfixed whole blood)."
"Together, these data support the concept that the CD14 epitope detected by the antibody used here (BCI clone RMO52) is not affected significantly by treatment with 50% cold methanol, but is affected following 80% cold methanol."
"In addition, these data show that the antibody-conjugate is also impacted by 80% cold methanol (MFI is lower for cells stained following fix-perm and 80% methanol treatment)."
These data should reinforce the concept that all of the details of fixation-permeabilization and methanol treatment need to be validated for the complete set of antibody conjugates used for a new experiment.
"For more information regarding the use of pre- or post-staining peripheral blood in relation to intracellular and CD epitopes, see ref."
[74].
"This technique [74] has been utilized to stain both cell surface and intracellular epitopes for the analysis of MAP Kinase, STAT, and ribosomal S6 signal transduction pathways in human bone marrow samples [72, 73].Open in a separate windowFigure 16.Effect of methanol treatment on CD14 staining of human peripheral blood monocytes."
Whole blood samples from one individual were stained with CD-14-PE-Cy7 before (left panels) or after (right panels) fixation and permeabilization.
Samples were treated with either 50% (top panels) or 80% (lower panels) methanol.
See text for details.5.5.
Fixation and permeabilization for non-adherent tissue culture cell preparations Routine fixation and permeabilization of tissue culture cells (anchorage-independent cell lines) is accomplished using formaldehyde fixation followed by permeabilization of cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes using absolute methanol.
"Although we routinely stain both cell surface and cytoplasmic or nuclear epitopes simultaneously, it is also possible to stain cell surface epitopes with some antibody conjugates prior to fixation and permeabilization [74]."
"This approach is particularly useful for cell surface markers that are altered (e.g., CD19) or destroyed (e.g."
"CD14, CD15, CD64) by fixation using alcohol treatment alone.5.5.1."
Determining optimal formaldehyde fixative concentration Optimal detection of phospho-epitopes appears to be influenced by the formaldehyde concentration used to fix different types of cells.
As shown in Fig.
"17, P-STAT5 in K562 cells is optimally detected following treatment with 0.05 to ~0.4% formaldehyde (37°C for 10 min)."
"Since the degree of potential epitope cross-linking/fixation is proportional to the formaldehyde concentration, incubation time, and temperature, all three of these variables should be controlled and performed identically each time."
As shown in Fig.
"17 at higher final formaldehyde concentrations, the P-STAT5 signal decreases, likely from overfixation, and limitation of phospho-epitope accessibility by antibody conjugates [75]."
As also shown in Fig.
"17, treatment with absolute methanol alone (no formaldehyde: first data point) results in a background level of signal.Open in a separate windowFigure 17.Effect of formaldehyde concentration on P-STAT5 immunoreactivity in K562 cells (reproduced from ref."
[75] with permission).
"Cells were fixed at 37°C for 10 min using increasing final concentrations of formaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained with anti-P-STAT5-PE as described.5.5.2."
"Routine fixation, permeabilization, and antibody staining for non-adherent cultured cell preparations For fixation and permeabilization of non-adherent tissue culture cells, we add the optimal formaldehyde concentration directly to sub-confluent cells (ideally re-fed 12–24 h prior to harvest) in tissue culture media (routinely containing 15–20% FBS), and return cells to the 37°C tissue culture incubator for 10 min."
"Cells are then centrifuged (400 × g for 10 min), and resuspended using a vortex mixer (note: cells are clumped at this point and require vigorous treatment with vortex to achieve resuspension of all cells)."
"While vortexing, absolute methanol (stored at −20°C) is added with ~1 mL absolute methanol per 107 cells being added."
"At this point, the cells can be stored in a well-sealed container at −20°C for several weeks with no significant decrease in the detection of phospho-epitopes (epitopes tested thus far).For staining of intracellular epitopes, place 3–5 × 106 cells into each tube (we routinely perform staining of tissue culture cells in 1.2 mL microfuge tubes)."
"Centrifuge tubes (for refrigerated microfuge, use 10 000 rpm for 12 s), carefully aspirate off supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL cold (4°C) wash buffer (Dulbecco's PBS/5% FCS or Dulbecco's PBS/5% protease-free BSA) while vortexing."
Place tube on ice for 5 min to allow buffer to equilibrate and remove residual alcohol.
Centrifuge as above.
"Repeat and wash twice with cold wash buffer.Carefully remove supernatant following the last centrifugation step, and resuspend cells in 100 μL of antibody conjugate (or antibody conjugate mixture)."
It is important that each antibody used is titrated to ensure optimal SNR.
Incubate cells with antibody (or antibodies) on ice (4°C) in the dark (if using photosensitive conjugates) for 30 min.Resuspend cells in 0.5 mL cold wash buffer for flow cytometry analysis (if cells are to be analyzed within 1–2 h).
"If cells will not be analyzed within 1–2 h, centrifuge the washed cells, and resuspend the cell pellet in cold PBS/0.1% paraformaldehyde."
"Cells post-fixed in 0.1% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4°C (dark) are stable (light scatter and phospho-epitope detection) for at least 24 h. It should be noted that the signal intensity of some phospho-epitopes start to decrease significantly within minutes of the final resuspension in cold wash buffer (e.g., P-S6)."
"For these epitopes, it is strongly recommended to immediately place the cells in PBS/0.1% formaldehyde, which significantly decreases the rate of signal loss.6."
Variable lymphocyte receptor antibodies6.1.
Overview Variable lymphocyte receptor antibodies of the evolutionarily distant jawless sea lamprey are structurally distinct from Igs of jawed vertebrates.
They recognize antigens with a high degree of specificity and can be utilized in various biomedical research applications in which their unique antigen recognition characteristics complement conventional antibody panels.
"In this section, we provide a protocol for the use of these novel reagents in multicolor flow cytometry applications.6.2."
Introduction The recently identified variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) antigen receptors of jawless vertebrates have contributed greatly to our understanding of the evolution of the adaptive immune system [76].
"Three VLR genes (VLRA, VLRB, and VLRC) have been described that are assembled by a gene conversion-like mechanism, and are expressed by cells reminiscent of αβ T cells, B cells, and γδ T cells, respectively, with VLRB being secreted in the form of disulfide-linked decameric complexes."
"Conventional antibodies utilize the Ig domain as the basic structural unit and are generated by recombination of the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments for the antibody heavy chain and the V and J gene segments of the antibody light chain."
As illustrated in Fig.
"18, the resulting antibody consists of an F(ab)/F(ab')2 domain that engages the antigen primarily via interactions mediated by residues located in the complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1, 2, and 3 whereas the Fc domain allows for the communication with various cells of the immune system to elicit biological responses."
The ability of antibodies to recognize their antigens with a very high degree of specificity and to label these reagents with fluorescent dyes makes antibodies the key component of most flow cytometric applications.
"Unlike conventional antibodies, VLR antibodies utilize the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) as a basic structural unit [77]; the resulting gene product assumes a solenoid shape (Fig."
"19A), wherein the corresponding antigen interacts with residues located at the inner concave surface, and with a variable loop structure protruding from the capping C-terminal LRR unit [78, 79]."
"VLR antibodies have become a novel class of highly specific biomedical research tools, by virtue of the vast VLR antibody repertoire."
"Interestingly, VLR antibodies appear to be particularly suited for the specific recognition of posttranslational protein modifications."
"Several monoclonal VLR antibodies recognizing carbohydrate moieties were described [80, 81] and recently our group reported the isolation of a monoclonal VLR antibody recognizing the HLA-I antigen in a tyrosine sulfation-dependent manner specifically on human memory B cells and plasma cells, a binding pattern distinct from those of any described conventional antibody [82]."
The distinctive antigen recognition characteristics of these VLR antibodies indicate that the unique origins and protein architecture of VLR antibodies may permit binding to antigens that conventional antibodies may not readily recognize because of tolerogenic and/or structural constraints.
An established protocol harnesses the expansive repertoire to generate antigen-specific monoclonal VLR antibodies with ready applicability in standard laboratory techniques such as flow cytometry and ELISAs [83].Open in a separate windowFigure 18.Structural characteristics of Igs.

Parallel β-sheets lining the concave antigen-binding surface are shown in blue and a variable loop structure involved in antigen binding is depicted in red.
The invariant stalk region necessary for multimerization of the secreted VLR antibody was omitted (Model was generated using the Protein Model Portal Algorithm [84]).
(B) Structural characteristics of VLR antibodies.
"Individual VLRB units consist of a signal peptide, N-terminal LRR (LRR-NT), LRR-1, up to nine variable LRRv units, a connecting peptide, C-terminal capping LRR (LRR-CT) and the invariable stalk region and can be modified by inclusion of engineered 6xHis and HA-epitope tags or Fc-fusion sequences.Several research groups have used monoclonal VLR antibodies, either unmodified or engineered as Fc fusion proteins for purification using protein A/G columns and detection with a variety of commercially available reagents recognizing the IgG Fc domain."
"Alternatively, purification is also readily performed using Ni-columns targeting an engineered 6xHis epitope tag followed by detection of the VLR antibody with reagents specific for the incorporated HA-epitope tag (Fig."
19B).
"Here, we describe a protocol for use of VLR antibodies in multicolor flow cytometry analyses of human PBMCs in combination with conventional, directly labeled monoclonal antibodies."
"Depending on the type of VLR antibody used and the expression levels of the targeted antigen, a two-layer or three-layer staining approach can be used (see below for protocol)."
The use of monoclonal VLR antibodies with engineered epitope tags or VLR-Fc fusion proteins permit a more efficient two-layer staining approach.
The use of unmodified monoclonal VLR antibodies or experiments targeting antigens expressed at low levels require a three-layer staining approach since the established anti-VLRB monoclonal antibody 4C4 cannot be readily modified with common labeling systems that target primary amines.
"Several positive and negative control reagents for VLR-based experiments have been described [83, 85].6.3."
Experimental workflow and acquisition 6.3.1.
Reagents Fluorescently labeled anti-epitope tag or Fc-specific reagents are available from several commercial sources.Monoclonal mouse anti-VLRB clone 4C4 [86].
"Note that this antibody is reactive with an epitope in the stalk region of all VLRB molecules, and it displays impaired antigen-binding characteristics following modification with amine-reactive dyes.Negative control monoclonal VLR4 antibody (specific for the BclA antigen of the exosporium of B. anthracis [83]).Positive control VLR32 antibody (specific for human CD5) [87] or VLRB MM3 antibody (specific for human CD38 on plasma cells) [85]."
"Suitable cell lines for testing of positive controls are the Jurkat T-cell leukemia and the Daudi Burkitt’s lymphoma, respectively.6.3.2."
"Two-layer staining approach Incubate PBMC with monoclonal VLR antibody in PBS/0.5 BSA for 25 min on ice (v = 40 μL).Wash with PBS/0.5% BSA.Resuspend cells in antibody cocktail containing fluorescently labeled lineage-specific conventional monoclonal antibodies and fluorescently labeled anti-epitope tag antibodies (or anti-Fc antibodies if VLR-Fc fusion proteins are used), incubate for 15 min on ice.Wash twice with PBS/0.5% BSA.Resuspend in PBS/0.5% BSA/1 μg/mL PI and analyze by flow cytometry.6.3.3."
"Three-layer staining approach Incubate PBMC with monoclonal VLR antibody in PBS/0.5% BSA for 25 min on ice (v = 40 μL).Wash with PBS/0.5% BSA.Resuspend cells in PBS/0.5% BSA, add anti-VLRB clone 4C4 at a concentration of 1 μg/mL and incubate for 15 min on ice (v = 40 μL).Wash with PBS/0.5% BSA.Resuspend cells in PBS/0.5% BSA, add fluorescently labeled goat anti-mouse reagent (typically at a 1:300 dilution), incubate for 15 min on ice (v = 40 μL).Wash with PBS/0.5% BSA.Resuspend cells in PBS/0.5% BSA/5% normal mouse serum, incubate for 10 min on ice."
"(Blocking step, see “Pitfalls” below)Add antibody cocktail containing fluorescently labeled lineage-specific conventional mAbs, continue incubation for 15 min on ice.Wash twice with PBS/0.5% BSA.Resuspend in PBS/0.5% BSA/1 μg/mL PI and analyze by flow cytometry.As is the case with all conventional antibodies, monoclonal VLR reagents must be titrated prior to use and 2 μg/mL serves well as a starting point."
"While background signals with the negative control VLR4 are not typically observed, negative control stains lacking any VLR antibody, in addition to negative controls or the various conventional antibodies, should be routinely included.6.4."
Pitfalls Potential omission of blocking step in three-layer staining approach.
This blocking step is important to prevent binding of directly labeled antibodies from the next incubation step to potentially unoccupied binding sites of the goat anti-mouse reagent from the previous step.7.
"New antibody reagentsAs discussed earlier in this chapter, the determination of specific binding of antibodies to antigens and Fcγ receptors as well as nonspecific antibody binding to cells can be difficult."
"Furthermore, the critical role of antibodies and their limitations are known and published [88]."
"Therefore, to improve the data reliability in these respects, further advanced technologies are desirable and various antibody products with improved characteristics are available."
A few of them are discussed here.Miltenyi Biotec developed the REAfinity antibodies.
"These are recombinant antibodies, which are engineered by cloning of the antibody-binding region of mouse or rat mAbs with the human IgG1 Fc region."
The construct is expressed in a mammalian cell line under standardized conditions.
"To eliminate any binding of the recombinant antibodies to the Fcγ receptors, the Fc region of the antibody is mutated suggesting that no blocking of the Fcγ receptor binding sites on the target cell surface is necessary."
"Since all recombinant antibodies are derived from human IgG1, the same isotype control antibody can be used to prove that there is no binding of any REAfinity antibody to the Fcγ receptors on target cells."
Additional advantages are proposed to be a very high antibody purity and a very good lot-to-lot consistency due to the standardized antibody expression by the used cell lines.
"Other companies, such as Enzo Lifesciences, provide recombinant antibodies as well.Another type of antibodies without any reactivity to mammalian Fcγ receptors is the chicken IgY [89], making it an alternative to be considered for improving data accuracy."
"One more possibility to reduce error sources, when analyzing cells with high multiparameter panels, is the use of the Duraclone system provided by Beckman Coulter."
"These are pre-formulated antibody panels, which are unitized and dry, allowing an easy work flow, since no pipetting and antibody mixing is necessary."
"To perform the staining, the cell suspension (e.g., a sample of whole blood) needs to be added to the lyophilized antibody mixture."
"Due to that standardization, a reduced staining variability can be expected."
"Additionally, the panel does not need to be developed, in contrast leading to a reduced flexibility, although drop-in markers are provided."
"Solutions to stain samples for compensation are included in the available kits.Another technology to be mentioned here, because it allows a huge flexibility (especially if a primary conjugated antibody fluorochrome combination is not available) is the Zenon labeling system by Thermo Fisher Scientific."
"It consists of Fab fragments conjugated with fluorochromes, which target the Fc region of primary, non-conjugated antibodies."
The creation of that complex can be performed with very small amounts and it is very fast.
"It needs only some minutes, although remaining unbound Fab fragments should be captured afterward by addition of nonspecific IgG."
"Also, the ratio between the Fab fragments and the primary antibody needs to be titrated to obtain the desired degree of binding and therefore the staining intensity."
"After staining the cells, a fixation based on aldehydes might be beneficial to preserve the staining and to prevent the transfer of Zenon labels from one antibody to another one."
"Since the Zenon labeled antibodies are significant bigger than directly labeled primary antibodies, there might be limitations when using them especially for intracellular staining.It should be noted that this section should not be understood as an advertisement to specific products."
Rather it is an incomplete selection of some materials on the market to get an overview about different systems.
"Other related or comparable products, which are not discussed here, are offered by various companies."
"Nevertheless, the discussed materials might help improving the data quality."
"However, irrespectively which of the discussed techniques are used, the researcher needs to gain an impression if the used material will indeed help to create more accurate results."
"Furthermore, the same controls, as stated above, should be considered to ensure the reliability of the obtained data.IV."
Cell sorting1.
Pre-enrichment of low abundant cell populations prior to acquisition/cell sorting1.1.
Introduction One of the major advantages of flow cytometry is the capability to measure multiple parameters per cell with a speed of several thousand cells per second.
This allows the measurement and detection of rare cell populations with frequencies below one in one million cells (1/1 × 106).
"But even with this relatively high number of cells analyzed per second, a lot of time is required to acquire a significant number of rare cells for statistical analysis."
"Assuming a frequency of one cell of interest per 1 × 106 cells in a given sample, one would need to acquire a minimum of 1 × 109 cells to have at least 103 cells of interest at the end of acquisition."
"The average acquisition speed of many flow cytometric analyzers, at which they will detect and acquire all incoming signals without significant loss due to coincident or electronic aborts, is around 104 cells/s."
"It would therefore take more than 24 h to acquire enough of the described sample in order to reach the 1000 cells of interest.While this time calculation is basically true for many available flow cytometric analyzers, for cell sorting, the time calculation is different."
"Here, additional parameters come into focus."
"In common flow cytometers that hydrodynamically focus the cells in front of the laser intersection point (point of fluorescence detection, see Chapter I Section 1.2 Hydrodynamic focusing), the speed of the carrier stream is given by the system and only the volume of sample running through per time can be adjusted by the user."
"In contrast, the fluidic of most cell sorters is more variable and allows adjustments of speed and flow-through volumes at various steps (both on the sample and instrument side)."
"In many cell sorting experiments, there is a demand to maximize both the yield and purity of the sorted cells and minimize the time you need to run your cells through a machine."
"Yield and purity influence each other and are both dependent on the speed (cells running through a sorter per second) and the frequency of cells of interest (see Chapter IV, Section 2.1)."
"Unfortunately, they cannot be maximized both at the same time."
"The less abundant a cell population is, the lower the speed of sorting has to be, in order to ensure a high yield with an acceptable purity (>95%)."
"If you speed up (increase the number of cells running through the machine per time), your yield will drop significantly (up to 50% in some cases) or alternatively, the purity is sacrificed for a higher yield obtained in a shorter period of time (see Fig."
20).
"Therefore, sorting 1000 rare cells with high purity could last twice as long as the acquisition only (the relation between speed, frequency of cells, yield, and purity are discussed in more detail in Chapter IV, Section 2.1)."
"This crude calculation only accounts for the time needed for acquisition and cell sorting; not counted is the time already invested in preparing and staining the cells (see, e.g., Chapter III, Section 3).Open in a separate windowFigure 20.In cell sorting experiments one often needs to find a compromise between purity, yield, and time, which cannot be optimized all at the same time.Given that flow cytometry as a method allows the identification and quantification of individual cells within a given population and given that in cell sorting this decision takes even more time, thereby slowing down the process, it is obvious that enumeration/evaluation of every single event especially of samples with large cell numbers prior to sorting is not a practicable way to go about analysis and sorting of rare cell populations."
"How then can we achieve acceptable work times and make it possible to analyze those rare cell populations?We need a reduction in workload, meaning a reduction of the amount of cells that need to be measured in the flow cytometer."
"One way to overcome this situation is to get rid of as many “unwanted” cells as possible prior to acquisition, in the form of pre-enrichment."
Cells can be separated from each other in many different ways and some methods of pre-enriching rare cells before flow cytometric analysis are discussed below.
"Because same pre-enriching techniques can be used as standalone bulk sorting approaches, the following section complements the subsequent chapter about parallel cell sorting."
"Requirements and pitfalls analysing rare cells are discussed in Chapter V, Section 1.In general, we can distinguish methods based on physical properties (such as density and size) or using immunological features (antibodies coated to beads or magnetic particles) as discussed in the following two sections.1.2."
Pre-enrichment by physical properties Physical properties of cells may be exploited to enrich them.
"For instance, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells within a mixed cellular population adhere to plastic and are in general adherent within the first 2 h of being incubated on a Petri dish."
Cells other than macrophages and dendritic cells can be removed and washed off with the supernatant.
"After longer incubation periods (≈20 h), dendritic cells start detaching from the plastic again."
"With this method, an enrichment of up to 70% could be reached for dendritic cells."
"This method is used in the process of generating and isolating dendritic cells out of monocytes and macrophages derived from blood or bone marrow [90, 91].Another simple method to eliminate unwanted events is the lysis of red blood cells (see also Chapter IV, Section 2.5 and Fig."
"22B), which are a common “contaminating element” in tissue preparations."
"In contrast to nucleated cells, erythrocytes burst upon brief exposure (<60 s) to a hypotonic medium (e.g., erythrocyte lysis buffer: 155 mM NH4Cl; 10 mM KHCO3; 100 mMEDTA)."
Remember that human and mouse erythrocytes differ in size and ability to resist hypotonic shock over time.
"Various buffers and protocols are available, which differ in temperature and exposure time, affecting lysis outcome."
"It is therefore necessary to adapt the lysing protocol to the experimental conditions ([92–94] and Chapter IV, Section 2.5).Open in a separate windowFigure 22.Enrichment of human B cells out of whole blood stained for CD45 BV421 and CD19 APC."
(A) Staining prior enrichment.
(B) Staining after lysis of erythrocytes with Lysing-buffer.
(C) Staining after CD19+ MACS® enrichment.
(D) Staining of the CD19− fraction (MACS® flow through).Peripheral PBMCs can be enriched by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll®.
"This biological inert polysaccharide allows the separation of PBMCs from plasma, granulocytes, and erythrocytes based on their cellular density (Fig."
"21) (see also Section IV.2: Parallel cell sorting: 1.3.1 Ficoll-Paque™, Lymphoprep™).Open in a separate windowFigure 21.This figure shows a summary of discussed enrichment methods."
(A) The separation of different cell types with a Ficoll® density gradient is shown.
"(B) Once one applies a centrifugal force in an elutriation chamber, cells will stop passing through and start separating along a density gradient built inside the chamber."
"The equilibrium formed depends on the speed of the cellular flow, the amount of applied centrifugal force, and the viscosity of the medium used."
This is the reason why elutriation is compatible with a wide range of cell types and carrier media.
"(C) Target cells (black) can form aggregates with antibody-labeled beads and If you add beads that are coated with specific antibodies against your target cells (black) to the cell suspension, the target cells will form aggregates with the beads."
These aggregates are held back on the top of the mesh while the rest of the cell suspension is passing through.
With this method one can either deplete or enrich for a specific cell population.
"Combining different mesh and bead sizes is allowing for a serial enrichment of target cells.While many users report a lower recovery (up to 10–15%) in the absolute numbers of target cells after density gradient centrifugation, they profit from faster operational times in downstream assays and lowered costs, because fewer (staining) reagents in less buffer are needed for the significantly reduced total cell numbers."
"In functional assays, e.g., antigen presentation or proliferation assays and transplantation (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to reconstitute bone marrow and blood formation in irradiated mice), a higher cell viability and reconstitution frequency is reported when Ficoll-enriched cells were used, as compared to preparations without preenrichment via density gradients.Elutriation [95–97] is another method of separating cells based on their size, which uses centrifugal forces."
The technique is also called counter flow centrifugation and makes use of a modified elutriator rotor containing a separation chamber with which one can gently separate a large variety of cells from different tissues and specimens.
The cells are separated in this chamber mainly based on their different sizes by the opposing action of the centrifugal field generated by the rotation of the rotor and the liquid flow inside the chamber (Fig.
"21; centripetal, means in direction to the rotor axis (counter flow))."
"Because the separation is not dependent on a specific density gradient, this method is compatible with a wide set of media."
"Another big advantage is high viability and low activation of the cells, making it an interesting tool in a clinical environment [98].1.3."
"Pre-enrichment by immunological properties Although pre-enrichment methods based on physical properties (such as size, density, etc.)"
"are straightforward, they do not allow for functional or biological discrimination of sub-populations, e.g."
discrimination between T and B lymphocytes.
"To do so, immunological separation methods, which make use of antibodies to reach the specificity and cell population of interest, could be used.One of the first methods established (in the early 1970s) is antibody-mediated complement lysis of unwanted cells."
The cells (e.g.
"erythrocytes or T cells in a mixed lymphocyte pool) that you want to eliminate are detected and opsonized with specific antibodies (at the beginning serum from immunized animals were used, nowadays one can also use mAbs against the antigen of interest)."
"Soluble parts from the complement C system are added to the cell suspension, bind to the antibody-tagged cells, and lyse them [99, 100]."
"There are more “classical” methods to enrich different immune cell subpopulations, some of which are still in use."
These methods are summarized elsewhere [101] and are only mentioned to complete the overview.
"In the meantime, a variety of easier and more efficient techniques have become available."
"These techniques combine the advantages of beads and antibodies.To enrich or deplete subpopulations out of a heterogeneous cell population, one can use beads coupled with mAbs against antigens expressed on the cells of interest that bind to the antigens forming larger aggregates."
These cell-bead aggregates can now be easily separated from the unbound cells in the solution by passing the bead/cell-mixture over a mesh (Fig.
21).
"Cells that are bound to beads would not pass through the mesh, and are thus enriched on the mesh surface, whereas all other cells are smaller than the mesh-size and flow through."
"After filtration through the mesh, the antibody-coupled beads can be detached from the cells to allow the cells to be further analyzed."
Using varying sizes of mesh and beads make sequential separations possible.
"For example, the pluriBead® technology allows cell enrichment as well as depletion of specific subpopulations [102]."
Advantages and disadvantages of that technology are further discussed in Chapter IV Section 2.2.1.1.The most commonly used methods for pre-enrichment of subpopulations are based on beads passing a magnetic field.
A variety of companies offer different solutions for enrichment or depletion of cell populations.
One system of immunological pre-enrichment employing magnetic fields is the MACS® Bead-Technology [103].1.4.
"Magnetic pre-enrichment for high-resolution detection and analysis of rare cell populations For the detection and analysis of cell subsets that are detectable only in very low frequencies (<0.1%), appropriate pre-enrichment strategies, as detailed in the sections “Pre-enrichment by physical properties” and “Pre-enrichment by immunological properties,” may help improve gating resolution for the cell population of interest."
"Typical applications are the detection of hematopoietic stem cells [104], CTCs [105], dendritic cells [106], or lymphocyte subsets, such as antigen-specific T cells [107]."
"As one of the most commonly used pre-enrichment technologies immunomagnetic positive and negative selection strategies have been established (this has been exemplified in the context of detecting antigen-specific T cells (Chapter V Section 17.5.3, Fig."
67).
"Magnetic pre-enrichment is a unique tool to improve resolution of cell populations, e.g., via isolation of weakly labeled cells to achieve separation of “overlapping” populations, depletion of irrelevant cells, or enrichment of rare cells (Fig."
24).
"As described above for mesh-filtration based enrichment, the concept is based on the attachment of small, inert, supra-magnetic particles to mAbs specific for antigens on the target cell population.Open in a separate windowFigure 24.Improvement of population discrimination after pre-enrichment."
Cytometer histograms of unwanted (gray lines) and wanted (solid green) populations.

"(B) After a pre-enrichment bulk sort, which removes most of the unwanted population a good discrimination between the two populations can be achieved.Open in a separate windowFigure 67.Enrichment of antigen-specific T-cells increases sensitivity for the detection of rare cells."

Lower plots: Overlayed flow-cytometric analysis of birch-specific CD154+ and CD137+ cells.
Numbers indicate percentages among CD137+CD154− CD4+ T-cells and absolute numbers of CD137+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg.
"(D) To describe the precision of flow cytometry data, the CV can be calculated from the variance and the SD) For rare cell analysis, the approximations SD = √r and CV [%] = 100/√r can be used, where r is the number of positive events [635]."
From CV [%] = 100/√r follows r = [100/CV]2.
Using this approximation the number of total required events is illustrated depending on the frequency of target cells for different CVs.Cells labeled to these antibody-bead conjugates are then separated via a column containing a ferromagnetic matrix.
"By applying a magnetic field to the matrix, the beads stick to the matrix inside the column and the bead-carrying cells are held back from passing through (Fig."
22C).
Unlabeled cells can pass through the matrix and are collected in the flow-through (Fig.
22D).
"To elute the trapped cells from the column, the magnetic field is simply removed."
The MACS® technology therefore enables different strategies for positive enrichment or depletion of cells.
"MACS® beads are comparable small and offer the advantage of not interfering (too much) with downstream assays (see also Chapter V, Section 18.5)."
"In contrast to cell sorting, up-scaling the cell numbers does not significantly increase processing times."
"For some cell types (e.g., CD4+ T cells or B cells), a high enough purity can be achieved such that further enrichment is not necessary (of course this is dependent on the quality needed for the downstream assay, e.g., RNA/DNA purification)."
"Solutions using magnetic beads other than MACS® beads are also available for cell separation (e.g., Dynal® Beads [108] or BD iMag™ [109])."
The beads in these kits are generally larger than the MACS® beads and do not require a separate matrix to retain the cells in the magnetic field.
"The disadvantage of using these systems is that, for many downstream assays, it is necessary to detach the beads from the cells to avoid interference with the system.To pre-enrich your cells, you can choose a protocol from a variety of different techniques, which separate your cells based on their physical and/or immunological properties."
"Pre-enrichment could be useful to cut down the processing time of your experiment, increase the quality of downstream assays, or to reduce the amount of reagents needed.2."
Parallel cell sorting2.1.
"Introduction and general considerations Parallel or bulk cell sorting is generally used to isolate a large number of cells in a batch mode, often as a pre-enrichment step before a single-cell sort (see Section IV.1 “Pre-enrichment of low abundant cell populations prior to acquisition/cell sorting”)."
"Parallel sorting uses parameters such as cell size, density, magnetic, or electrical properties."
"Affinity binding reagents (e.g., antibodies) for specific cell subsets can be used to change specific properties, e.g., magnetism or density to achieve an antigen-specific bulk sort.General considerations: Bulk cell sorting from a cell mixture can be done by many methods, each one having different advantages and challenges."
"The main variable parameters to be considered are specificity, yield, purity, viability, and functionality."
"Moreover, speed, cost, and consumables for equipment must be also taken into account."
"The importance of the different functional parameters will depend on the specific experimental goals, e.g., very high purity may be essential in many cases, while yield may be less important, because sufficient material is available."
Instrumentation features depend on the specific needs and the experience of the user(s).
Figure 23 illustrates the various parameters needed in deciding on a sorting strategy or method.
Not always can all parameters be set at optimal levels simultaneously.
"For cell isolations, where multiparameter sorting is not needed, but where speed is of essence, e.g., because high numbers of cells must be sorted, bulk cell sorting is preferred.Open in a separate windowFigure 23.Check-list: Parameters for selecting a sorting method."
The parameters that affect cell sorting and therefore must be prioritized when choosing a sorting strategy are shown.
"Starting from the available material (amount, fragility), they range from the mundane cost aspect to practical and methodological concerns such as the available time, to the important experimental approaches regarding what yield, purity, or versatility is needed for down-stream applications."
"Optimization of one parameter may downgrade another parameter, e.g., a high purity may be at the expense of a high yield or speed, or unchanged functionality of the cells may not allow direct positive selection.Flow cytometry cell sorting, where cells are sorted one-by-one, is the gold standard for multiparameter cell sorting."
"This procedure yields very high specificity according to one or several surface markers, which are made visible by fluorescence-labeled antibodies."
The limitation is mainly the number of cells that can be sorted during a work-day.
"Pre-enrichment for subsequent flow cytometry cell sorting is another important application of bulk sorting and should always be considered, especially when the wanted cells are comparatively rare."
"First, because it reduces time of the cell sort, and second because it helps to improve gating quality by eliminating potential fluorescence overlap between stained and unstained cells (Fig."
24).
An overview of cell sorting technologies and applications can be found in ref.
"[110]Bulk cell sorting can either use any cell surface marker for distinction, or use distinct physical properties of cells, such as density differences (Ficoll™ isolation), size, plastic adherence, phagocytic capacity (macrophage enrichment), or sensitivity to hypotonicity (erythrocyte lysis)."
"Keeping track of cell numbers, viability, and analyzing the sorted cells before, during, and after any separation is good routine in order to determine cell yield and cell purity, and to detect any unreasonable cell losses or damages."
"Cell “yield” is the fraction of wanted cells in the original mixture that could be recovered alive after the sorting procedure.To quantitatively evaluate sorting performance, several calculations can be performed."
"The purity, i.e., fraction of positive cells in the sorted fraction, can be expressed as the ratio of positive cells and the sum of positive and negative cells."
"Then, using the measured purity and yield, the yield for nontarget particles, the negYieldFraction (Fraction = Percentage/100), in the target sample after sorting can be calculated."
This provides a helpful metric when optimizing a sorting technology.
"Ideally this number will be zero, when 100% purity is achieved in the separation."
"The negYieldFraction, a measure for how many unwanted cells are found in the sorted sample, can be calculated by re-arranging the equation:PurityFraction=posFraction∗posYieldFractionposFraction∗posYieldFraction+negFraction∗negYieldFractionto obtainnegYieldFraction=posFraction∗posYieldFraction∗(1.0/PurityFraction−1.0)1.0−posFraction.Another approach for the evaluation of bulk sorting performance is described in ref."
"[111], where it only uses fractions of cells in the original and positive fraction and does not need information about the yield of the positive (wanted) population."
The enrichment factor Fe in ref.
"[111] is the inverse of the negYieldFraction, if the yield of positive cells is 100%."
"At lower yields, there are small differences between the two metrics."
"Table 4 provides an example showing that final purity values alone are not a good measure for sorting performance (rows 4 and 5 in Table 4), even though it may be the important measure for biological activity.Table 4.Example of sort performance metrics."
"The values for purity, yield, and the fraction of positive cells in the original sample are measured and the negative logarithm of negYieldFraction, −log(Y−) (the underlying equations are detailed in the text (IV.2.1) and the logarithm of Fe [111] are calculatedPurity (%)Yield (%)Orig (%)−log(Y−)Log(Fe)95100501.281.2895  90501.321.2895  10502.281.2899  90  14.043.9995.6  90  0.14.384.34Open in a separate window2.2."
Antibody based bulk cell sorting Physical properties of cells can be changed by the reaction with specially tagged affinity reagents like antibody conjugates with magnetic particles.
"In this way, specific subsets can be isolated with bulk sorting methods.2.2.1."
Magnetic beads coupled to antibodies This technique uses the force of magnetism to sort out cells according to specific cell surface markers.
"Several commercial systems are available, which use either inorganic superparamagnetic or ferromagnetic materials embedded in polystyrene beads or in a matrix such as dextran, or coated with graphene [112]."
Beads in sizes from tens of nanometers up to several times the size of a typical mammalian cell are available for bulk cell sorting.
The bead-size is not disclosed by all companies.
"Cells are incubated with the beads and then drawn to a magnet of appropriate strength either in a column, tube, or 96-well plate."
"Nanometer sized beads require high field strength and field gradients, generally achieved in columns or microfluidic channels with optimized ferromagnetic structures."
Unwanted cells are poured off or eluted.
"In negative selection strategies, all unwanted cells are labeled, leaving the wanted ones untouched for downstream applications or a second round of selection by another surface marker."
Several bead or affinity reagent chemistries allow the detachment from the cells if needed.
"The bulk sorting method hinges on the quality of the antibodies used, and the density of the surface markers on the cells."
Cells with a low density surface marker expression may be more difficult to sort.
"Rare cell sorting is possible, albeit it may require several rounds of sorting and intensive washing to remove nonmagnetic cells."
"Bulk sorting with beads, especially with large beads, cannot distinguish between high and low expression of a given antigen on the cells."
"Selection of a good antibody is crucial for successful sorting, as is the concentration of beads in the labeling step."
Nonspecific binding associated with antibodies clustered on beads has to be addressed with some reagents and cell types.
"Nowadays, many kits for sorting a range of cell types in various species are commercially available."
"Custom-made beads may be a choice as well, and are offered by some companies."
"Conjugation of antibodies to magnetic beads in your own laboratory or the use of avidin beads with second-step labeling with biotinylated antibodies is another option.Advantages: Fast, high cell numbers, specific, positive, and negative selection possible.Pitfalls: No distinction of antigen density in sorting with larger beads (some nanometer-sized colloidal beads show some differences in magnetic retention in some systems [113]); activation of cells by bead attachment is possible (must be excluded for individual downstream applications)."
"Temperature and duration for binding must be considered (in the context of phagocytosis, decreasing possibility of nonspecific binding, capping, or efficient binding kinetics)."
Note: the sort quality must always be analyzed to detect possible cell losses and impurities.
"Also the cell viability can be influenced by buffers or bead sizes.Selected manufacturers:miltenyibiotec.com, Sepmag.eu, stem-cell.com, thermofisher.com, turbobeads.com, cd-bioparticles.com, biolegend.com2.2.1.1."
"Nonmagnetic beads coupled to antibodies Nonmagnetic beads coupled to antibodies (pluribeads®) use strainers to fish out cells, attached to large polystyrene beads."
The method is based on the size-enlargement of cells as the beads are larger than cells.
"Specificity is achieved by the antibodies and, again, the quality of the antibodies is important."
"As beads vary in size, several cell subsets can be sorted out of a mixture by using different sized beads for different antibodies."
A potential advantage is that the size of the beads may prevent phagocytic uptake.
"Beads can be detached by a special buffer, and sequential sorting is possible.Advantages: Fast, high cell numbers, specific, positive, and negative selection possible.Pitfalls: Generally no distinction of antigen density in sorting; activation of cells by bead attachment/detachment procedure is possible (must be excluded for individual downstream applications); nonspecific binding (the sort quality must be analyzed to detect possible cell losses and impurities)."
"Temperature and duration for binding must be considered (in the context of phagocytosis, decreasing possibility of nonspecific binding, capping, or efficient binding kinetics).Selected manufacturer:pluriselect.com2.3."
"Methods based on density differences Cells, organelles, parasites, and so on have different densities, and their density differences can be used for cell separation [114, 115].2.3.1."
"Ficoll-Paque™, Lymphoprep™ Ficoll-Paque™ contains Ficoll™, a highly branched polysaccharide, and metrizoate."
LymphoPrep™ replaces the latter with sodium diatrizoate.
Sidebyside comparisons of the gradient media have previously been done [116].
"They have low viscosity, are nontoxic, and can be prepared for different densities."
Ready-made solutions are also commercially available.
Ficoll-Paque™ gradients are frequently used to separate peripheral PBMCs versus granulocytes/erythrocytes from whole blood.
Efficient removal of dead cells from a mixture is possible as well (note of caution: this procedure is stressful for the living cells).
"When separating blood, the upper fraction contains both lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells."
"Addition of iohexol, a nonionic X-ray contrast agent, to the gradient medium can remove monocytes as well [116]."
"Nycoprep™ and OptiPrep™ are gradient solutions without Ficoll™, based on a tri-iodinated derivative of benzoic acid with three aliphatic, highly hydrophilic side chains or on iodixanol, respectively."
They thus are not based on a polysaccharide net [117].
"From the granulocyte/erythrocyte mix, neutrophil granulocytes can be isolated further by dextran sedimentation [118, 119], and erythrocytes lysed by hypotonic shock (see Chapter IV, Section 2.5).Advantage: Easy to use, little equipment needed.Pitfalls: Density for similar cells between species can differ (e.g., for mouse, horse, and human lymphocytes [120]); erythrocytes and granulocytes can become captured in the upper layer, if the gradient is overloaded or the blood was frozen."
Centrifugation must be done at room temperature and with the centrifuge brakes turned off.
The step of overlayering blood on the gradient is time consuming and must be done with care.
"Various commercially available systems such as SepMate™ exist to aid in this, including prepared Ficoll-gradients in containers to draw blood."
Loss of cells and recontamination when harvesting them from the gradient surface is possible.
"Cell activation can be an issue, e.g., when isolating neutrophils [118].Selected manufacturers:gelifesciences.com, http://www.stemcell.com/en/Products/Popular-Product-Lines/SepMate.aspxPercoll: A second density separation medium is Percoll, made from colloidal nanosized silica particles coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone [121]."
"Percoll is nontoxic and has a low viscosity, so cells can be centrifuged at low centrifugal forces."
Iso-osmotic gradients of densities between 1.0 and 1.3 g/mL can be formed by layering solutions of different percentages of Percoll in a tube.
Cells of differing densities collect at the different interfaces and can be taken off.
"Colored density marker beads made of Sephadex™ are helpful to visualize the density borders in the gradients.Advantage: Versatile, as several cell types separate in the different layers in one tube.Pitfalls: See Ficoll-Paque™; cell activation can be an issue and must be considered.2.4."
"Methods based on cell size Size differences of cells of interest, e.g., erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood, can also be used for separation.2.4.1."
Filters Membrane filters are applied in sample de-bulking as they can separate particles or molecules based on size.
The pore size enables larger cells to be retained on the membrane and smaller cells to pass through.
"For example, leukocytes (mean diameter 8–10 μm) can be isolated from erythrocytes (6–8 μm but disc shaped) by flowing whole blood through a membrane filter; back flushing will recover the captured white blood cells."
"However, classical filter membranes do not have homogeneous and precisely controlled pore sizes, so the resolving power of this separation is limited and, due to the material of the filter, the recovery of white blood cells may be inefficient.Another separation method based on cell size that targets red blood cells and platelets specifically uses microfibrated silicon chips."
These feature homogeneously etched slots of a certain size designed to let erythrocytes pass through under a certain pressure while retaining leukocytes on the surface of the chip.
The leukocytes can then be recovered by elution.
Early evaluation of this technology has demonstrated 98.6 ± 4.4% recovery of leukocytes without bias to any leukocyte subpopulation and 99% removal of erythrocytes.
The enriched leukocytes have over 95% viability [122].Mesh-size based catching of cells from adipose tissue directly in culture has been demonstrated using various filter materials [123].Advantages: Easy to use and little equipment is needed.Pitfalls: Throughput of the filters is limited by surface area and overload may result in reduced purity and recovery of leukocytes.
"So far the commercial devices can only handle up to 2 mL of whole blood, which is sufficient for some cell analysis assays but not enough for blood transplantation and cell therapy applications."
The recovery of leukocytes is sensitive to the pressure applied—pushing with higher pressure and higher flow rate may result in decreased recovery.Selected manufacturer:avivabio.com (for microchip devices)2.4.2.
Deterministic lateral displacement A method of bulk sorting currently under development is based on cell size.
There are several publications reporting a microfluidic device that separates particles and cells with high resolution [124] and is able to not only fractionate whole blood components by their sizes [125] but to also isolate CTCs from whole blood [126].
"Recent work describes improvements for the routine use of the technology for rare cell enrichment [127], for the isolation of leukocytes from whole blood [128], and for cell washing for cellular therapy applications [129]."
"The micro-fabricated silicon device consists of a matrix of obstacles, and the gap and the size of the obstacles are precisely controlled."
"When the particle mixture is introduced to the device, the laminar flow goes through the arrays of obstacles and the smaller particles will follow the streamlines and the larger particles will be “bumped” by the obstacles and deflected into a different flow stream."
Multiple sections of an obstacle matrix with varying gap sizes can be built in one device so that multiple sized particles can be isolated because each sized particle will follow its own determined path flowing through the device.
"In theory, there should be no throughput limitation of the technology as it is a continuous flow system; however, some surface treatment of the device may be needed to avoid cell adhesion."
"The device has little tolerance to clogging, air bubbles, or cell aggregates, as changes in the fluid flow profile alter the particle travel path and deflect the flow streams possibly resulting in decreased purity and/or recovery.Advantages: High resolution, continuous separation, and having the potential to be high throughput, high resolution size discrimination with high purity of cell populations with nonoverlapping sizes.Pitfalls: Clogging with samples with cell aggregates.Manufacturer: Contact gpbscientific.com for quote for custom fabrication.2.4.3."
Acoustic particle sorting Particles exposed to an acoustic field are known to move in response to an applied acoustic radiation force.
Numerous researchers have investigated the effect of acoustic waves on cells and particles in aqueous solution.
"The force exerted on a particle by an acoustic field can be described by the following equation:Fx∼r3KΦsin(2πx/λ)where r is particle radius, K is a constant proportional to density of medium and particle, φ is the acoustic contrast factor (proportional to density and compressibility), and x is the distance from the pressure node in the direction of the wave [130]."
"Thus, acoustic focusing can be used to separate and position particles based on size, density, and deformability."
The ultrasonic standing wave is generated by a piezoelectric transducer and resonance vibration of the microfluidic device made in silicon or glass.
The channel width is designed to match half a wave length resonance of 2 MHz in order to have larger cells “focused” in the middle of the channel.
[131]) demonstrated the removal of platelets from peripheral blood progenitor cell product on a microfluidic device in which an acoustic standing wave is generated in the fluidic channel.
The acoustic pressure pushes leukocytes to the pressure node located at the center of the channel and leaves platelets at the side stream going to a waste outlet.
Size is a dominant parameter for acoustic cell sorting but not the only parameter as shown in the equation above.
"For example, separation of leukocytes from erythrocytes in whole blood is not easily done on an acoustic device as erythrocytes, although having a smaller diameter, move to the acoustic energy node along with leukocytes as the erythrocytes have a higher density."
"Recently, optimization of the technology has been achieved and the preparation of mononuclear cells from diluted peripheral blood has been reported [132].Advantages: Continuous flow—no throughput limitation, label free.Pitfalls:The cell moving trajectory in the flow channel is determined by both the acoustic pressure and the shear pressure so the flow rate and channel configuration need to be well controlled otherwise the separation efficiency will suffer."
"Due to the heterogeneous nature of cells in biological sample and the multiparameter physics of acoustic separation, separations have to be optimized for specific samples.Manufacturer:acousort.com2.5."
"Erythrocyte lysis Enucleated erythrocytes are more susceptible to hypotonic shock than nucleated cells (see also Chapter IV, Section 1.2)."
"Either a low isotonic Tris/NH4Cl buffer for several minutes at room temperature or 37°C, or pure water for several seconds will lyse erythrocytes in cell mixtures."
"The latter method is particularly useful for blood, which contains approximately 1000 times more erythrocytes than leukocytes."
"Several other cell lysis solutions are available commercially as well [92, 93].2.6."
"A historical note The methods described in Chapter IV, Sections 2.2–2.5 have superseded older methods to specifically isolate cells, such as panning on antibody-coated plastic dishes [133], nylon–wool based isolation of T cells, or sheep red blood cell rosetting followed by a Ficoll gradient [134, 135]."
"The latter is still commercially available under the name RosetteSep™ for specific uses, in particular for the removal of unwanted cells from blood and can be considered a protocol still in use."
"These older methods are not discussed here, but they are summarized in ref."
[101].3.
Serial cell sorting3.1.
Cell sorting by flow cytometry Successful cell sorting by flow cytometry often requires that more attention be paid to sample preparation than is typically done when preparing samples for analysis only.
"When sorting, the often-challenging objective is to not only separate some sample fraction in a timely manner such that the sorted output is a pure viable fraction, but also that the sorted cells be functionally capable, that they expand well in culture or perhaps be competent to perform in some other subsequent assay (e.g., produce cytokines or some other vital cellular function)."
"Another requisite for good cell sorting is to have a proper single-cell suspension, ensuring a desirable sample behavior in flow where good doublet discrimination can be performed with minimal conflict aborts during the sort."
How to best achieve good sample behavior and maximize performance?3.1.1.
"Choice of buffers The most commonly used media/buffers for processing mammalian cells were designed to work at 1 atmosphere pressure either on a laboratory bench or within a CO2 incubator, yet inside the sample chamber of most cell sorters the pressure can often exceed 2 to 4 atmospheres depending on the conditions and nozzle size chosen for the sort."
"Sample buffers that historically tend to perform well for sorting such as Dulbecco’s PBS or HBSS (minus Ca++ and Mg++), both with 10 to 25 mM HEPES and protein (usually 1 to 2% heat inactivated serum or BSA), and more recently BD FACS™ Pre-Sort Buffer plus from 0.2 to 2% protein (application dependent) are recommended."
"Bicarbonate media buffers such as Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) or DMEM usually do not make the best candidates for sample sort buffers or sort collection buffers since they (i) are a different buffer type than the cytometer's sheath buffer (bicarbonate vs. phosphate), and (ii) by design require 5% CO2 to maintain physiological pH, and (iii) usually contain divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) plus phenol (very fluorescent)."
"If a bicarbonate media is used, one should be wary and use either Ca++ or Mg++ minus formulas without phenol or mitigate the undesirable divalent cation side effects for sorting (making the cells “sticky”) by adding ~1 mM EDTA in addition to 25 mM HEPES and protein."
HEPES buffered bicarbonate media has been reported to be light sensitive [136].3.1.2.
Considerations for adherent cells and cells isolated from solid tissues In preparing adherent cell lines for sorting a common pitfall is often within the protocol to remove the cells from a dish using trypsin or trypsin-EDTA and subsequently inactivate the trypsin by adding back culture media containing a significant amount of serum.
This step is designed to stop the proteolytic activity of the trypsin and make the cells “sticky” to easily adhere to a plastic dish when passaging the cells.
"The opposite is desired for cell sorting by flow cytometry, the sample should not be “sticky” with a tendency to adhere to plastic."
"As a result, good flow cytometry cell sorting protocols for adherent cells will typically either inactivate the trypsin with soybean trypsin inhibitor or use one of the many available nonenzymatic cell disassociation buffers (e.g., Accutase™); in either case, if the cells grow in media with serum, the culture should be gently rinsed twice with Dulbecco's PBS before disassociating and removing the cells from their substrate."
"Some cell types, when disassociated with nonenzymatic disassociation buffers that rely on chelating agents, may show decreased viability as compared to trypsin disassociation [137]."
"If there is any doubt, a few simple pilot experiments designed to determine the best preparation method for the specific cells in question is often a very good investment toward successful sorting, since things like EDTA can affect certain cell types [138].Similarly, isolating cells from any primary tissue for flow cytometry cell sorting can be very challenging, care should be taken to ensure the chosen protocol is optimized and tested to not only provide the intended cells (e.g., regarding isolated dendritic cells from spleen different protocols can enrich for different phenotypes) but helps coerce the cells into a well-behaved single-cell suspension."
"The highest quality reagents should be used, especially when using proteolytic enzymes such as collagenase, pronase, dispase, or trypsin since small amounts of contaminants can have serious undesirable effects resulting in poor sample performance."
"Collagenase is dependent on calcium for activation, for example, and other divalent cations may be activators (Zn++) or inhibitors (Mg++) [139], and care should be taken to ensure any additive endotoxin levels are as low as possible.3.1.3."
"Stickiness to plastic: A menace of cell sorting When performing bulk sorts and collecting a sorted fraction into a plastic tube, it is usually best to precoat the tube with serum leaving some at the bottom, or if desired, additionally seed the tube with a small volume of the sample buffer containing 2 to 10% serum."
"Adding unbuffered bicarbonate media to the collection tube and sorting on top of it runs the risk of high pH conditions causing undesirable salts to form while the phosphate and bicarbonate buffers mix with the cells present, thereby reducing cell viability."
"When performing single-cell sorts into a microtiter plate, any media pre-added to the wells should be HEPES buffered and conditioned beforehand if possible."
"Additionally, when sorting onto/into small targets such as microtiter plate wells extra care should be taken to ensure the accuracy of the deflected drops during the sort by choosing an appropriate nozzle size to minimize the effects of cells on drop breakoff [140] (choose a nozzle at least five to six times the cell diameter as verified under a microscope).3.1.4."
"Cell concentrations and sorting rates Once prepared, the sample should have a final cell concentration that allows the desired event rate to be achieved with only a modest differential pressure on the sample."
Increasing the sample rate significantly by simply forcing more through the system is not recommended.
The sample should be filtered just prior to being loaded onto the sorter to help ensure no clumps are present and further disperse any weakly adhered cells.
"After filtering the sample through a Nitex nylon monofilament mesh with an appropriate pore size (30–50 μm depending on cell size), any samples that tend to dynamically re-aggregate during a sort are best dealt with by installing an in-line nylon sample filter of the same pore size to help prevent clogs."
"Generally, since the theoretical sorting efficiency of a single cell preparation is that of a homogeneous Poisson process [141], the operational efficiency of the sorter may be estimated byEfficiency=e−(rate×(1.0−fraction)×droppacketfrequency)where rate is total events/s, fraction is percent being sorted, drop packet is the number of drops including any additional temporal purity mask, and frequency is the drop rate in drops/s."
"Normalizing to sorter drop frequency, this means when sorting a fraction that is 10% of the total at an event rate of one cell to every four to five drops, it can be expected to sort with an efficiency of 80 to 85% when using a single drop sort.3.1.5."
"Purity and doublets If, after optimizing the sorter during set up, suddenly the application sorting efficiency is low (higher than expected conflict abort rate), it is indicative that the sample is not a monodisperse cell suspension, that cells are likely “sticky,” adhering to one another during entrainment and not arriving into the sensing zone as a homogeneous Poisson process."
"This is a very common scenario with many cell preparations, especially adherent and primary cells, and often the sorter performance is blamed for what is a behavior intrinsic to the sample."
Much of the time this can be significantly mitigated by reexamination of the sample preparation protocol to discover what might be improved to help coerce the cells into a well-behaved single-cell suspension.
This often involves the addition of EDTA or DNase etc.
"to the sample sort buffer.Whenever a sorted sample using a purity sort mode (where system-defined spatial-temporal drop zones in the stream are examined logically for potential contaminants for each sort event) is not as highly sorted as desired, the most common reasons are that either the classification scheme for single cells is not robust enough and hidden passenger cells are occasionally sorted, or that there are particles in the stream that are disturbing the droplet breakoff stability and, as a result, the wrong drops will occasionally appear in the collection tube, or a combination of the two."
"Sorters certainly cannot read the operator's mind and will attempt to do exactly what they are setup to do so, if a positive selection from the sorter suffers from disappointing purity, one simple performance check is enough to sort a completely negative cell fraction for comparison."
"If that sorted negative fraction is 99% pure or higher, yet the positive fraction is only 80 to 95% pure, then the likely cause is undetected “doublets” due to an insufficiently constrained single-cell gating strategy."
"In many flow systems, doublets tend to align with the doublet figure's major axis in line with the partially developed laminar flow and the pulse width becomes a very useful parameter to help distinguish singlets from doublets."
"Other systems, such as the BD FACSAria™ family that use fully developed laminar flow in their fluidics design can have those same doublet figures rotate off axis after entrainment in flow such that forward scatter (FSC) pulse width alone will not detect enough doublets, and in such cases using both FSC and side scatter (SSC) looking at plots of Height versus Width (or Height versus Area—but that usually leaves less screen real estate for drawing gates) will help reveal many more doublets, boosting the purity to a more acceptable level with careful gating."
Figure 25 (reproduced with permission from ref.
[142]) is an example of such a strategy where pulse geometry gates on both FSC and SSC detect an additional 9% of doublets that would pass through a standard scatter gate.
"Matching nozzle size to particle size is key, and the general rule of thumb is that the nozzle should be four to five times that of the particles for bulk sorting and five to six times that of the particles for plate deposition where accuracy is more critical."
"Ensure that the actual cell size is what you expect it to be when choosing a nozzle, and whenever there is doubt it is very useful to quickly compare to known bead size standards by simply putting small drops of each on a microscope slide and checking, not only the size(s) within the sample but also the quality as the amount of debris should be low, the number of single cells high, and clumps/aggregates should be the rare exception rather than the rule."
"Electrostatic cell sorters tend to perform very well with monodisperse samples and struggle with poorly dispersed ones so, as with many other applications, sample preparation can be the limiting or enabling step."
"The International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) Cell Sorter Biosafety Standards were published in 2014 by the ISAC Biosafety Committee [143], and related information is readily available and is a highly recommended reading before embarking on any series of cell sorting experiments including:The ISAC web site (http://isac-net.org) Resources for Cytometrists → BiosafetyCYTO University (ISAC’s on-line portal for cytometry education) http://cytou.peachnewmedia.com → Course: Flow Cytometry BiosafetyOpen in a separate windowFigure 25.PBMC Sort."

Gating Strategies Most real-world sort samples are a complex mixture of cells in various states and contain varying amounts of debris and dead cells; identifying and sorting the cells of interest while excluding unwanted populations and debris is done by “gating” the sample using selected features and some number of graphical gate regions combined with Boolean logic.
This can become complex in high dimensional experiments where it is now possible to sort cells based on over 30 dimensions on some instruments (such as BD FACSymphony™).
"Any classical gating strategies used to phenotypically identify the cells may not be the most effective or even possible to use for the purposes of sorting, especially if the number of gates is high or the population of interest is identified through a variety of clustering methods or a dimensionality reduction technique such as tSNE [144] or UMAP [145]."
"Algorithms such as GateFinder [146], Hypergate [147], and Hyper-Finder [148] tackle this problem where analytical methods or data projections are unavailable in the cell sorter by treating the identified population of interest as a training set, and computationally determine an optimal feature set and gating strategy by using data dimensions that do exist in hardware to sort the population."
"These algorithms objectively optimize feature selection and gate efficacy by means of an F1 measure, the harmonic mean of precision (purity) and recall (yield) at each gate step."
"Since the real-time sort decisions within the sorter are done extremely rapidly within onboard electronics, it is always desirable to find a gating strategy that is efficient and uses as few gates as possible."
"When population analysis and identification is by computational methods, then creating a set of optimal sort gates by means of an appropriate optimizing algorithm becomes necessary.3.1.7."
Prevention of cell sedimentation Long-term sorting often leads to sedimentation of the cells.
"The sedimentation rate of cells in a fluid depends on their physical properties such as density, cell size, cell shape, viscosity of the surrounding medium, and gravity [149]."
"In addition, the effective density of a cell is also affected by its water content, and thus the sedimentation rate is not a constant property for an individual cell type [149, 150].Sedimentation of cells can be avoided by shaking or rotating the sample tube, or stirring with the sample line inside the cell sorter (BD FACS [151])."
Rotating unidirectionally is not very effective since the sedimentation is delayed but not prevented.
"For example, the threshold rate of human leukocytes decreases to 80% after 30 min of cell sorting and then to 50% after an additional 15 min."
"Moreover, the constant rotation of the tube, especially if cells stick between the lower end of the sample line and the tube bottom, acts like a “cell crasher.” A more effective and gentle treatment is achieved by shaking or pipetting the cell suspension."
Another possibility is the use of Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) to keep the cells in a homogeneous suspension.
SAWs are generated on the surface of a piezoelectric crystal by applying a high-frequency electrical signal to specially formed pairs of electrodes deposited on the crystal [152].
"By use of a coupling fluid (e.g., water) between the crystal and the sample tube, the SAWs are conducted to the sample via the tube bottom."
This allows a mechanical and gentle resuspending of the sample by acoustic streaming.
"This approach is specific in that it uses low amplitudes and high frequencies and is therefore not detrimental for living cells and can be implemented in a cell sorter (e.g., BD FACSAria™) [153].Furthermore, the sedimentation of cells can be controlled by using isopycnic (i.e., equal or constant density) media [154]."
"This can be achieved by using various reagents, e.g., Percoll®, Ficoll®, HBSS, Nychodenz®, Xanthan Gum [149, 154, 155]."
"For example, a 60% Percoll solution results in a media density of 1.07 g/cm3, which is equal to the density of human lymphocytes but different from that of human erythrocytes (1.10 g/cm3)."
"However, in practice the sedimentation rate of both cell types is decreased or stopped and therefore sedimentation is drastically minimized."
The toxicity of the final buffer should be tested by leaving cells in the buffer overnight at 4°C and the resultant cell viability should not be below 80%.3.1.8.
"Trigger and threshold To facilitate the discrimination of particles of interest from background events, it is useful to define a minimal signal value, the threshold value, which a particle passing the optics of a flow cytometer must reach to be actually recognized as an event."
The threshold value defines the signal intensity above which the cytometer starts to recognize an event and therefore limits the number of events coming from background signal (Fig.
26).
Every event showing a lower signal than the threshold defined will not be processed by the cytometer electronic and will not be represented in the data file.
"Therefore, it is advisable to look for a leading parameter (i.e., a parameter with a clear discriminator for the population of interest) as the trigger parameter, and predefine a threshold value."
This fact is important to consider when it comes to cell sorting.
"Because the instrument ignores events below the threshold, they are not being included in the process of the sort decision."
"Consequently, sorted fractions can get contaminated due to the fact that these “invisible” particles are in fact still part of the sample."
"When the droplets are formed these particles can end up inside or in the neighboring drop of a target cell because the settings of the sorting mask are ignored, resulting in a contamination of the sorted fractions."
"It is therefore recommendable to use the minimal threshold value possible for identifying the required population.Open in a separate windowFigure 26.The threshold value defines a signal intensity, in one or more parameters, above which the cytometer starts to recognize an event."
All other events will be invisible to the instrument’s electronics.
A particle passing the laser beam emits a certain amount of light over time.
The threshold is set on the height of the signal that is emitted by each particle.
On the left-hand side a dotplot with the forward scatter as the trigger parameter is shown.
Only particles with a signal higher than this threshold value are recognized by the software as an event and shown in the dotplot (black and orange dots).
The dots in on the left side of the threshold value (grey and blue dots) are not included in the data file.The default setting of the trigger parameter on most instruments is set to forward light scatter.
"Alternatively, a fluorescence parameter can be used for triggering."
"The discrimination of small particles, e.g., platelets, erythrocytes, or extracellular vesicles, is often more specific when the threshold can be set on a fluorescent signal (e.g., a common surface marker or even autofluorescence that clearly defines the target population) as background discrimination in FSC and SSC is often difficult."
A combination of several threshold parameters can also be used to set the threshold more strictly.
"In this case, the event must meet the value of multiple thresholds to be processed by the flow cytometer."
Such a threshold combination is often used when the expected signal of a particle is quite close to the background noise of the trigger channel.
"As threshold levels are applied to pulse height (H), it is advisable to set threshold values while viewing pulse height [24], especially if the trigger parameter might be a fluorescence parameter where signal levels are low and the main contributor to area is pulse width (W)."
"For many cytometers, pulse height and width are not collected by default and have to be chosen in the instrument setting beforehand.3.2."
"Microfluidic Recently, microfluidic devices have entered the arena of flow cytometry and, in particular, cell sorting devices [156–159]."
"As these devices also utilize sequential sorting and similar fluorescence detection technologies to identify the cells of interest, best practices for microfluidic devices have a lot in common with those applicable to droplet sorters."
"This is especially true for considerations regarding sample preparation, such as choosing the right marker panel or appropriate buffer selection as discussed above (See Chapter IV Cell sorting)."
"While sequential sorting technologies have a lot in common, there are also some major differences and knowing and understanding these differences is key to successful application."
"One of the biggest differences is that droplet sorters are typically operated in resonance [160], whereas many microfluidic sorters are operated purely on demand [158, 161, 162]."
"To explain further, operated in resonance means that the drop generating nozzle is running in resonant mode, stably generating a constant stream of drops."
"This way, drop volume and spacing is fixed and cells are randomly “positioned” inside the drops."
"This contrasts with many microfluidic sorters, where the displaced volume can be fine-tuned in size (volume) and time/space (centering the target cells)."
"Although the enabling principles vary, the sorting effect is mainly generated by displacing a certain volume [161, 163]."
"Given that the sort-timing is precise and correct, this volume defines expected purities and yields of target cells."
"In an ideal system, target cells and nontarget cells are totally uncorrelated and thus follow a Poisson distribution [164]."
"In the case of a “yield sort,” where all target cell candidates are to be sorted independently of the nontarget cells nearby, the expected yield is 100% by definition."
"The expected purity can be calculated as follows: Let λt be the average number of target cells per displaced volume, then the relative number of sort-actuations is defined by Nλt = e−λT."
"For each displaced volume, there is a chance to catch a nontarget cell, defined by λn, the average number of nontarget cells per displaced volume."
"With this, the expected purity P can be calculated to beP=11+λNe−λT.On the other hand, in case of a “purity sort,” every time a second cell is in close proximity to a target cell, the potential displacement will be inhibited."
"Thus, the theoretical purity is 100%, whereas the expected yield decreases."
"In this case, the yield calculation is simply the likelihood of having a single cell within the displaced volume:Y=(λN+λT)1(λN+λT)1!e(−λN−λT)=e(−λN−λT)Besides the obvious close formal relationship between the two formulas, it is worth noting that the expected yield in a purity sort is solely determined by the total cell frequency (λn + λt) and not by the target/nontarget ratio, whereas the expected purity in yield sorts is strongly dependent on the target cell frequency."
"In order to give a practical example, these two figures are here calculated for a virtual sorting device assuming that the microfluidic sorter:has a sample flow rate of 4 mL/h and does not require a sheath to be operated.is able to redirect 100% of the sample stream into the target cell reservoir for 50 μs and then instantly return the flow back to the nonsorted fraction.uses a sample with 106 total cells/mL with 0.1% target cells.This translates to a flow of 1.1 μL/s and cell detection frequency of 1.1 × 103 total cells/s."
"Since in this example 0.1% of all cells are target cells, the target cell frequency is 1/s; resulting in an average time of 1 000 000 μs between target cells and 900 μs between any two cells."
"Given that the sorting volume displacement is done in 50 μs, λt and λn can be calculated as:λT=50μs1.000.000μs=0.00005λN=50μs900μs=0.056Thus, the expected purity in a yield sort would beP=100%1+0.056e−0,00005=96%Similarly, the expected yield in a purity sort would beY=100%⋅e(−0.05605)=96%Using the same calculation for 1 × 107 total cells/mL and 1 × 108 total cells/mL, generates the data presented in Table 5."
"The key observation here is that, even though the resulting purity in the above yield sort example is limited, especially when processing input material with a concentration of 1 × 108 total cells/mL (Table 5), the enrichment from 0.1 to 18% purity is still 180-fold."
"This opens up the opportunity to utilize a sequential sorting strategy, where a fast yield sort is followed by a purity sort."
"When starting the experiment with the higher frequency yield sort from the above example, the first pass would have theoretically yielded an 18% pure target cell fraction being processed with a rate of roughly 100 000 cells/s."
"If re-suspended again in the original volume, the second pass is processed with a total cell count very close to the one in the first example and would have yielded the target cells in a greater than 99% pure fraction."
The above is demonstrated with a microfluidic sorter using a MEMS sorting chip in a completely closed cartridge performing a CD34+ cell enrichment from a nonmobilized donor.
As seen in Fig.
"27, the staining pattern and gating strategy is straightforward."
The target cell frequency was determined to be 0.08% and the total concentration was chosen so that the 109 total cells were suspended in 10 mL solution.
"From there, a yield sort was carried out, with a flow rate of 4 mL/h."
The resulting cell processing rate was 110 000 total cells/s.
"With a target frequency of 0.08%, approximately 90 sorting actuations per second were expected."
The enriched cells were then re-suspended in 10 mL solution and processed a second time for purity.
The results are shown in Fig.
28.
"As a result of this sequential sorting strategy, with an overall sorting time investment of only 5 h, a result was achieved equaling a typical 20 h single-pass sort.Open in a separate windowFigure 27.Staining pattern and gating strategy for a CD34+ enrichment."
The cells are stained with CD34-Pe and CD45-APC.
"For analysis purposes only, PI was added for post analysis only.Open in a separate windowFigure 28.Result of a sequential sorting process."
109 total cells have been processed sequentially in 5 h to a final purity greater than 99%.
"Overall 280 000 target cells have been harvested from 800 000 target cells starting material, resulting in an overall yield of approximately 35%.Table 5.Expected purities, yields and processing times for different starting cell concentrationsTotal cells/mL106107108Purity in Yield Sort [%]  966918Yield in Purity Sort [%]  966411Time to process 109 cells309313:05Open in a separate windowSince microchip sorting devices are particularly powerful in sorting cells gently due to the absence of high shear forces or electrostatic charges, they are ideally suited to follow such a sequential sorting approach."
"The rarer the target cell population or the higher the total cell count, the more advantageous this method becomes.4."
Collecting cells4.1.
"Introduction Even if a cell sorter is well adjusted, i.e., the instrument is able to deflect the right drop with the cell of interest at the right moment, it is still possible that the drop does not hit the collection vessel, due to issues regarding the relationship between cell size, nozzle size, sheath fluid temperature, and pressure stability."
This results in a low sort yield and sometimes low purity.
Optimal collection efficiency therefore depends on the setup of the cell sorter as well as the position and properties of the sample collection tubes.4.2.
Cell sorter-specific parameters For a cell sort with high purity and yield an optimal gating strategy and detector setup is mandatory.
"Often, the discrimination between stained and unstained cell populations is problematic if they have a high overlap."
"In “dim” populations (i.e., low signal intensity, e.g., due to low marker expression or weak fluorochrome) the distribution of the cell events is dominated by the photon counting statistic of the PMTs and the background light and electronic noise of the detection channel."
"In other words, when the light intensity emitted from a single cell is measured by a PMT, the specific signal has an additive part of a constant amount of nonspecific signal (coming from the background light, electronic noise, etc.)."
"Thus, when a specific cell signal decreases, the nonspecific part remains stable and more and more dominates the entire signal and hence the distribution of the population."
"Consequently, the relative position of a cell inside a dim population is dominated by the background signal."
This can lead to low cell recovery if gates are not well adjusted.
Proper staining controls such as FMO [165] controls instead of unstained/single stained cells are very helpful to find the real boundaries of cell populations (see Section III.1: Controls: Determining positivity be eliminating false negatives).
"Furthermore, an optimal SNR by choosing the required PMT gain is essential for good population discrimination and optimal cell recovery [48].Modern cell sorters can sort up to six cell populations simultaneously in collection devices equipped with tubes (e.g., Falcon® 5–50 mL round buttom tubes, 1–2 mL microcentrifuge tubes)."
"Depositions of single cells in multi-well culture plates or onto slides, are also possible."
"Droplet sorters allow drops to be charged on different charge levels either positively or negatively, which allows drops to be deflected either to the left, far left or to right, far right."
"Deflection streams containing populations with the highest number of events to be sorted should be placed close to the center stream (i.e., left or right), since the focusing of the deflection streams is often better if their deflection is low."
"This minimizes the risk of cross contamination between the collection tubes.Furthermore, the position of the deflection stream should be monitored during the sort process."
"This can be achieved by using the AccuDrop™ technology (BD FACSAria user’s guide [151]) that consists of a red diode laser for side stream illumination, a filter block, and a camera mounted in the back of the sort chamber."
The camera provides an image of the deflection streams with the intercept points of the laser beam.
"This allows the user the monitoring of the deflection stream quality in terms of position, focusing, and stability."
Some sorters allow the monitoring of the break-off point using a camera and control the amplitude of the drop drive frequency depending on the camera image.
This keeps the break-off point in a stable position by increasing or decreasing the amount of drop drive energy to the stream.
"This is a useful approach as long as the viscosity, density, and pressure of the sheath fluid is stable."
"If not, the cell recovery decreases even if the position of the break-off point is stable."
Rapid temperature fluctuations of the sheath fluid of 1–2 K inside or next to the nozzle can become critical for cell recovery as well as for the side stream focusing.
"Therefore, good air conditioning or a sheath cooling [18] a device is highly recommended.The side stream position for cells sorting in multi-well plates is essential and needs to be verified by test sorting of the target cells because the final drop positioning is often slightly different for beads or other cells."
"For single-cell sorting of 384-well plates, a plate cooling device is recommended to avoid evaporation of the cell media.4.3."
Sample collection tubes The collection tubes can differ in terms of material as well as size.
Polypropylene tubes are preferable over polystyrene tubes because the cells adhere less to the tube wall.
Polystyrene tubes may build up the charge of the deflected drops on their surface.
"This can generate cross-contamination between collection tubes due to “jumping drops” caused by repulsion of incoming drops but can be prevented by using a grounded wire connected to a bent injection needle hung over the side of tube, such that the needle is in the fluid [154]."
Different tubes sizes can be combined in a specific tube holder depending on the flexibility of the cell sorter.
"Moreover, a custom made tube holder became available recently as 3D print file [166].The size of the collection vessel should fit to the expected volume of the sorted cell suspension and is correlated to the drop size and therefore to size of the nozzle."
"For example, 4 × 106 cells fill approximately a 5 mL Falcon® tube (12 × 75 mm), when using a 70 μm nozzle."
The same amount of cells would require five 5 mL tubes when a 100 μm nozzle is used.
"Especially for long-term sorts, these correlations should be concerned, in order to prepare enough collection tubes beforehand."
"On the other hand, there is a high risk that cells may not be recovered in the collection tube if the tube size is much higher than the expected sample volume.Collection tubes should be coated with proteins to avoid that the sorted cells stick to the tube wall as this results in reduced recovery and viability."
This can be done by filling the tubes with 10% FCS 30 min before sorting or incubated overnight at 4°C with 10% BSA.
"As a general rule, the collection tubes should be prefilled with a small volume of media optimized for the cells of interest."
This prevents the dehydration of the sorted cells and keeps the cells under optimal conditions to ensure their viability [167].5.
Flow-Cytometric Cell Sorting under GMP Conditions5.1.
Introduction Flow cytometric cell sorting is a versatile and well-established research tool to isolate cells in high purity and speed.
Multiparameter sorting permits the identification and isolation of specific cell subpopulations based on qualitative and/or quantitative antigen expression as well as on positive and negative selection criteria within a single selection procedure.
"With the advent of numerous cell therapy approaches for clinical applications, mainly driven by the success of chimeric-antigen-receptor-modified (CAR) T cells [168], interest in the clinical use of flow cytometric sorting is rising."
"Yet, cytometry-based cell sorting under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions is not yet available in a ready-to-use format and custom-made solutions pose a major challenge as stringent rules and regulations must be obeyed."
The authors of this section established GMP-compliant and approved flow-sorting technologies and protocols adhering to European guidelines and regulations for the isolation of regulatory T cell subpopulations to generate homogeneous cell products for the treatment of patients with graft-versus-host disease [169] within clinical trials.
"Based on their experience, a “list to consider” for researchers envisaging the implementation of flow sorting for medicinal products is provided, but not an “easy to use recipe,” as manufacturing rules are complex and vary for each product depending on cell source, applied reagents, manufacturing process, cell specifications, (inter-) national and regional regulations, and various other issues pinpointed in this section."
"Thus, the first issue to clarify when flow-sorting is envisaged for the production of medicines is the clinical need and benefit as compared to established and/or approved alternative cell enrichment technologies, taking into account the efforts and implementation costs for GMP-compatible flow cytometric sorting.5.2."
"GMP: Regulatory Requirements and Product Classification When cellular products are supposed to be administered to patients, strict requirements have to be obeyed including international, national, and regional laws, rules, and regulations."
"For pharmaceutical manufacturing, GMP principles have highest priority and adherence to these guidelines is inspected by regulatory agencies during the manufacturing authorization process and regularly thereafter."
GMP rules shall ensure high quality and batch to batch consistency for pharmaceutical products to prevent harm of patients caused by deviations during drug manufacturing.
"In contrast to the United States, full GMP-adherence is required within the European Union (EU) even for phase-I clinical trials [170], including cell therapy studies."
"Main areas covered by these GMP-regulations include detailed prerequisites concerning (i) quality management system, (ii) personnel, (iii) facility and equipment, (iv) documentation, (v) manufacturing, (vi) quality control, (vii) external suppliers, (viii) complaints and callbacks, and (ix) self-inspections.The regulatory landscape in Europe is complex and became even more so since the category “advanced therapy medicinal products” (ATMP) was introduced by the European Commission (EC) in 2008 to discriminate unmanipulated blood products and tissues from gene therapy-, somatic cell therapy-, and tissue engineered medicinal products."
ATMPs are medicinal products “containing cells or tissues that have been subject to substantial manipulation so that biological characteristics [ … ] have been altered”.
"They “have properties [ … ] to treat, prevent or diagnose a disease through the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action of its cells or tissues” [171–173]."
"“Substantial manipulation” in this context is defined in Annex I to regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 [174] where those manipulations are listed that are not considered substantial (e.g., cutting, grinding, centrifugation) and thus do not result in classification of a product as ATMP (then regulated as conventional blood, tissue, or cell products)."
"Thus, flow cytometric cell sorting itself does not lead to classification as ATMP, unless additional cell manipulations before (e.g., gene transduction) or after cytometric sorting (e.g., in vitro stimulation or expansion) are performed."
"In such cases, ATMP-specific GMP rules installed in 05/2018 by the European Commission must be obeyed [171].5.3."
"Facility and Equipment GMP rules concerning facility and equipment focus on controlled manufacturing conditions to ensure final product quality with a particular focus on the prevention of (cross-) contaminations (e.g., by particles or microbial agents)."
"Thus, the facility and equipment must be qualified for the intended purpose and environmental conditions during manufacturing must be tightly monitored (e.g., controlled air flow and pressure, temperature, humidity, environmental particles, sterility, and so on)."
"Based on thorough risk analyses and embedded in a detailed quality management system, qualification of the facility and all equipment (such as a flow-cytometric cell sorter) is performed in a stepwise fashion with particular attention on the intended performance and the inherent risks of a manufacturing process:Design qualification (DQ) Documented verification that the proposed design of the facilities, systems, and equipment is suitable for the intended purpose."
"Thus, an upfront description of the intended use and definition of quality criteria for a manufacturing equipment (and/or the whole facility) is required and defined in “user requirement specification” (URS) documents.Installation qualification (IQ) Documented proof that the URS are met by the equipment after its installation at the manufacturing site.Operation qualification (OQ) Documented proof that the equipment is suited for the intended purpose and meets all predefined quality criteria when in operation.Process qualification (PQ) Documented proof that the equipment is suited for the intended purpose within the whole manufacturing process of a pharmacologic agent.During cell sorting with a stream in air cytometer the cells are exposed to the environment."
"Even instruments using cuvette flow cells contain open handling steps where the cells are exposed to the environment, therefore both techniques require clean room conditions class A (laminar air flow hood) in a class B room."
The classification of clean room conditions in Europe is based on the maximal permitted airborne particle numbers as described in Annex 1 to part I of the European GMP guidelines (Table 6).Table 6.Maximum permitted airborne particle concentration for each cleanroom grade (modified after EU GMP Guidelines Annex 1).
"Annex 1 to the EU GMP Guidelines defines the maximum permitted number of particles equal to or greater than 5.0 μm/m3 as 20, corresponding to an ISO classification of 4.8."
ISO class 5 would permit 29 particles equal to or greater than 5.0 μm per m3.
ISO = EN ISO 14644.
"Other clean room definitions apply to the US and other non-EU countriesMaximum permitted number of particles/m3 equal to or greater than the tabulated sizeClean room gradeAt restClean room gradeIn operationAnnex 1ISO0.5 μm5.0 μmAnnex 1ISO0.5 μm5.0 μmA5/4.8352020A5/4.8352020B5352029B7352 0002900C7352 0002900C83 520 00029 000D83 520 00029,000D–Not definedNot definedOpen in a separate windowAs no commercially available cell sorter is designed to meet these criteria, we cooperated with a cytometer manufacturer and a laminar air flow provider specialized in manufacturing equipment for the pharmaceutical industry and installed the cell separation chamber of the sorter in a custom-made laminar air flow bench qualified to meet class A clean room conditions while all auxiliary equipment potentially emitting particles (due to their air cooling systems) are contained in a separate air-filtered (in- and outlet) cabinet (Figure 29).Open in a separate windowFigure 29.Custom-made GMP-compliant flow cytometric cell sorter (A) with auxiliary equipment cabinet (left) and laminar air flow hood (right) containing the sort chamber and (B) the sort unit in operation (safety-cabinet-enclosed sort unit seen between the two operators).For cell therapy medicinal products batch to batch cross-contamination by cells, infectious agents or subcellular components (e.g., RNA or DNA) must be omitted and aseptic conditions are required."
"With conventional flow-cytometric cell sorters validation of line clearance is almost impossible as it must be proven for each potential microbial contaminant (bacteria, fungi, viruses, endotoxins) and the test systems themselves for sterility testing have to be validated."
"To circumvent these problems, we use a sorter permitting the exchange of the whole fluidics system after production of each batch that is then replaced with a new sterile (γ-irradiated) single-use kit."
Some providers currently develop new sorters that use mechanical valves or air pulses in closed systems for fluorescence-based cell separation that may significantly facilitate GMP-compatible flow sorting in the future.5.4.
Raw Materials For the manufacturing of cell-based medicinal products a variety of raw materials are required.
"Hardly any of these raw materials, e.g., fluorescence-labeled antibodies for sorting, are covered by a pharmacopoeia or have ever been used for production of a medicinal product before."
"Since they come into direct contact with the cells, they are classified as critical for the safety, purity and potency of the final product."
"Therefore, in-house specifications, considering all potential risks, have to be provided if no reference to pharmacopoeial monographs can be made."
"Minimal requirements for quality control of critical raw materials are identity, biological activity/potency, toxicity, content, purity, sterility and microbial safety (including mycoplasma where applicable), viral safety, risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (where applicable), and stability."
"As these quality criteria reach back at least two generations (thus, definition of environment, equipment, and quality standards during the production of the respective materials), it is pivotal to ensure their highest possible quality for cell manufacturing."
"Since hardly any GMP-compliant (fluorescent-labeled) antibodies for flow-sorting are currently commercially available, they have to be custom-made by a qualified manufacturer.5.5."
"Process validation, quality control, and product release Process validation usually has to be performed prospectively with production of at least three batches."
"However, it is accepted by most authorities that process validation of investigational medicinal products (IMP; for clinical trials) cannot be as complete as for authorized (marketed) medicinal products."
Guidance on process validation is provided by the European Medicines Agency (Guideline [175]) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Guidance for Industry [176]).
"During process validation not only predefined final release criteria have to be examined, but also process-related impurities."
"These may originate from the cells (e.g., proteins, DNA), cell culture media (e.g., antibiotics, media supplements), or downstream processing equipment (e.g., columns)."
"Most often they originate from raw materials for cell processing, e.g., cytokines, antibodies, serum, culture media, chemicals, enzymes, and nucleic acids for genetic modifications."
"Since at least some of these substances (e.g., cytokines and stimulatory or sort-antibodies) may have an influence on the therapeutic cell product and/or may put a patient at risk even if administered in residual amounts (e.g., immunogenicity of antibodies, in vivo activity of cytokines), their presence in the final cell product has to be evaluated (ICH Q6B) [177]."
"Based on the potential risk, strategies for the determination of impurities may be arithmetical (calculation of residual amounts based on starting concentration and dilution factors or washing efficacy) or analytical (quantitative or limit test for impurities in the final product)."
"While the arithmetical approach may be suited and accepted for impurities with low risk profile, evaluation of a particular impurity may be necessary or requested by the authorities for every batch if substances are suspected to bear a significant risk for the recipient (e.g., biologically active antibodies, toxic fluorochromes)."
"Since standardized methods for the analysis of impurities are usually not available, respective test systems have to be designed and validated individually in advance (proving the appropriateness of an assay with respect to sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, detection limit, range and limits of quantitation, robustness, and repeatability) [178], which is at least laborious and time consuming.A successfully validated manufacturing process is a prerequisite to receive a manufacturing license by the respective authorities for cell therapy medicinal products that are either applied within clinical trials (separate clinical trial approval required) or as authorized medicinal products."
"In Europe, each cellular product for clinical use must be released by a qualified person who is responsible for the GMP-compliant manufacturing and final quality of the product."
"Predefined quality and release criteria typically include parameters such as volume, cell numbers, cell concentration, viability, identity, purity, potency, cellular contaminants, sterility, endotoxins, mycoplasma negativity, visual control, and eventually impurities (e.g., for sort-antibodies)."
Almost all assay systems for these quality controls (including flow cytometry-based tests) have to be developed individually and specifically for a given cell product and require validation (same criteria as described above) during the development of the manufacturing process to ensure their adequacy.5.6.
Final Remarks The huge advantages of multi-parameter flow cytometric cell sorting with its speed and flexibility in a research environment thus far do not apply to GMP-compatible sorting.
The high demands on the quality of auxiliary and raw materials and on the environmental conditions as well as stringent quality assurance measures and controls require a precisely structured and long-term preparation phase for each cell manufacturing process that cannot easily be changed once established.
"Thus, product characteristics and manufacturing tools and methods for an envisaged clinical cell product must be defined in detail in preclinical testing and be robust enough to justify the implementation of an expensive and strenuous manufacturing process involving flow cytometry."
"Most importantly, the clinical benefit and advancement has to be considered in comparison to established and comparably “easy to use” cell enrichment technologies."
"Yet, once established it is satisfying to witness that cell purities easily exceeding 95% are regularly achieved with GMP-compatible flow sorting, which may be relevant in certain clinical situations such as GvHD therapy."
The increasing interest of clinicians in cell therapy may motivate equipment and reagent manufactures to invest in financial and intellectual resources for the development of GMP-compatible flow sorting equipment and to provide a broader range of suited sort reagents in the near future.V.
Biological applications1.
Rare cells: General rules1.1.
"Introduction Rare cell populations are of growing importance in several fields, from basic research to translational medicine and diagnostics."
"In several clinical settings, rare cell counts provide valuable information on the status and stage of the patienťs disease."
"Some examples are rare CTCs in the peripheral blood, tumor stem cells, circulating endothelial cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells and their subpopulations, and fetal cells in maternal circulation."
"Interesting applications of rare cell analysis include the detection of metastatic breast cancer cells [179] or neuroblastoma cells infiltrating the bone marrow [180], monitoring of minimal residual disease [181, 182], detection of stem cells and rare HIV-infected cells in peripheral blood [183], antigen specific T cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, and analysis of mutation frequencies in genetic toxicology [184]."
"Moreover, polyfunctional assays, such as the Ag-induced production of different cytokines by T lymphocytes, are often performed, and these raise the problem of finding rare cells within these T-cell populations as well."
"In this section, the main issues of this topic will be discussed, including the amount of biological material required, the use of pre-enriched populations, the number of markers to use and cells to acquire, the importance of excluding doublets and the use of a DUMP channel.1.2."
"Optimization Studying rare cells requires attention, optimal methodologies in all phases, including collection of biological samples, well-defined controls, and adequate use of software and hardware [185]."
"The term “rare” generally refers to events with a frequency of 0.01% or less, although the record claimed in the literature has long stood at one cell in 10 million for tumor cells spiked in the peripheral blood [186, 187]."
"For this, the acquisition of a large number of events (see Section V.1.2.3: Number of acquired events) and a high SNR (see Section V.1.2.5: Thresholds, gating, and DUMP channel) are the most relevant aspects.1.2.1."
"The quantity of the biological material On the basis of the estimated frequency of the rare cells under investigation, it is crucial to calculate how much biological material is required."
"For example, if the endpoint of the experiment is to enumerate rare cell populations present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), considering that only a few milliliter can be obtained from a patient, it is logical that all the CSF has to be used."
"If blood is the biological matrix of interest, the rare cell population of interest and the pathology of the patient should be considered in depth."
"Should the endpoint of the study be the evaluation of cytokine production after in vitro stimulation by cells such as iNKT cells in patients with HIV infection, some pre-analytical considerations should be taken into account."
"For example, iNKT cells are extremely rare among peripheral PBMCs (0.01–1%), and in order to define this population several markers must be used, including those for recognizing CD3, CD4, CD8, invariant TCR, as well as those for cell viability and several cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 could be of interest, meaning that nine markers are required."
"HIV+ patients who do not take antiretroviral therapy are obviously severely immunocompromised, and have a low number of CD3+ T lymphocytes."
"Thus, the amount of blood required to detect a reasonable number of rare cells (according to Poisson statistics) can be as much as 50 mL of blood, since either resting or stimulated cells have to be analyzed [188].1.2.2."
"Enrichment and choice of markers On the basis of the experimental endpoint(s) (e.g., phenotyping, functional assays), the rare population may be enriched or not, and the number of markers that are needed to unambiguously identify a rare cell population needs to be defined."
"For example, the accurate quantification of circulating endothelial cells and their progenitors, shown in Fig."
"30, is a matter of debate."
"Several studies have been published, but no consensus has thus far been reached on either the markers that should be used to identify these cells, or on the necessity of a pre-analytical enrichment (by density gradient, buffy coat, and/or magnetic enrichment)."
"The enrichment, however, can have negative effects if rare cells are lost, or these effects may be positive, if unwanted cells are removed [189–193]."
"Unfortunately, quite often, the lack of well standardized methods influences the decision regarding the number of markers, which are necessary for the identification of the population of interest."
"Depending on the technical characteristics of the flow cytometers, which have a varying number of fluorescence channels and the speed of acquisition, the most important marker allowing the identification and characterization of such populations should be decided."
"For example, in the case of iNKT cells, the Vα24Jα18 invariant TCR allows the unique identification of these cells."
"Having done that, the marker panel has to be built following a general rule that the brightest fluorochrome has to be used for the weakest expressed marker."
"Finally, attention should be paid to compensation, and acquisition of FMO controls, which is covered in more detail in Section II.1: Compensation and Section III.1: Controls: Determining positivity by eliminating false positives.Open in a separate windowFigure 30.An example of a gating stategy for rare cells."
Gating stategy used to identify circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and their precursors (EPCs) among peripheral blood leukocytes.
"(A) Debris and aggregates were eliminated using FSC-Area versus FSC-Height, (B) possible clogs were removed using the parameter Time versus SSC."
(C) A DUMP channel was used to remove CD45+ cells and dead cells from the analysis.
(D) Nucleated cells were identified based on Syto16 positivity.
"(E) Stem cells were identified according to CD34 positivity, (F) EPCs (CD133+, CD31+) and CECs (CD133−, CD31+) were identified."
"The expression of CD276, also named B7-H3 (G, I), and CD309 (H, J), also named VEGFR-2 or KDR, was evaluated in each subpopulation."
"In this example, more than 10 million events were initially acquired in order to enumerate a population that, according to the literature, is always represented less than 0.1%.1.2.3."
"Number of acquired events Concerning the number of events that need to be acquired, it is recommended to use Poisson statistics, which defines the probability that a given number of events will occur in a fixed interval of time/space, assuming these events would occur with a known average rate and independently of the time elapsed from the previous event [194]."
"Therefore, Poisson statistics are applied to count randomly distributed cells in a certain volume."
"Let us consider a general case of enumerating a total of N events, of which R meet a certain criterion (i.e., they are positive, P)."
"In this case, a proportion of P events is defined as P = R/N."
"The probability of any single event to be positive is obviously 0 ≤ P ≤1, and this is related to the random manner in which cells are selected for analysis."
"As with all statistical distributions, the variance, Var, is a fundamental parameter, and is defined as: Var(R)= NP(1 − P)."
"The SD is the square root of the variance, and the CV is the SD equal to 1/square root of Var [195]."
These equations can be used to examine some practical situations.
"Let us consider a phenotype analysis of human PBMCs stained with a mAb for detection of B cells (e.g., CD19 mAb)."
"In healthy individuals, 10% of the cells can be positive, so that: P = 0.1 and P(1 − P) = 0.09."
"Good experimental practice suggests to keep CV below 5%; thus, acquiring even 5000 events could be sufficient, because the CV is 0.047 (i.e., in percentage, 4.71%)."
"Using a number of cells such as 10 000, the CV becomes 3.33%."
"However, should positive events be less frequent, a higher number of events must be acquired."
"Table 7 reports an example for events whose frequency is 0.01%, as often occurs studying antigen-specific T cells.Table 7.Example to calculate the number of acquired events for a rare cell population representing 0.01%Acquired events(N)10 000500 0001 000 0004 010 00010 000 00020 000 000Positive (R)15010040110002000Proportion (P)0.00010.00010.00010.00010.00010.0001Variance (Var)0.949.99100.0400.1999.91999.80Standard deviation (SD)0.97.0710.0020.0231.6244.72Coefficient of Variation (CV)100.0014.1410.004.993.162.24Open in a separate windowThis is clearly the ideal methodology."
"However, real life is different from theory, and very often the final number of events cannot be high enough to satisfy this golden rule."
"For example, we can consider the case in which one million peripheral T cells are stimulated with an antigen that activates less than 0.1% of them, namely 100 cells in one million."
"Nowadays, by polychromatic flow cytometry, T-cell activation can be analyzed by evaluating the polyfunctionality of these cells, and protocols have been developed that can identify in a relatively easy manner four or even five functions per cell."
"Thus, among responding cells, up to 32 populations can exist, likely with a different frequency, and each subpopulation contains a few cells that are completely absent in the control, unstimulated sample."
"Can we consider such cells positive, even if their number is much lower than that indicated by a strict statistical approach?"
"A pivotal paper by Mario Roederer, an opinion leader in this field, gives us very useful and clear suggestions [196]."
"Indeed, if alternative explanations for the presence of such positive events can be excluded (i.e., if there is no noise due to dead cells or fragments, and if cell activation is really due to the antigen used in vitro and not to a pre-activation in vivo of T cells), the events can be considered positive, irrespective of their number."
"Thus, there is no reason to fix a threshold for the number of events below which any frequency must be considered “negative” [196]."
"In this case, “positivity” can be determined after comparison of the measurement against a set of control samples, among which the adequate negative controls, using standard statistical tools to compare the frequencies."
"For example, assuming that from the technical point of view the experiment is well performed, if T cells from “n” unvaccinated controls show no activation after the stimulation with the adequate peptides, while T cells from “n” vaccinated individuals do, even extremely low frequencies can be taken as positive."
"The same logics can be applied in thousands of other cases, assuming that the relative controls are well chosen.1.2.4."
"Sample concentration and flow rate Because it is crucial to acquire a high(er) numbers of events for detection of rare cell population, sample concentration and flow rate are critical parameters, which can typically shorten acquisition time."
"However, care must be taken that increasing the flow rate results in an increase of coincidence, and thus higher CV, if flow cytometers use hydrodynamic focusing (which is the system used at present in most commercially available flow cytometers).1.2.5."
"Thresholds, gating, and DUMP channel A threshold should be fixed in order to distinguish the signal (using fluorescence or scatter) required to define the population of interest from the noise/background (see Section V.2: Trigger, thresholds, and live gating)."
"Hence, maximizing the SNR of the cells of interest is mandatory."
"Gates should be drawn to exclude dead cells, identified by viability marker, doublets/aggregates/debris, and all the unwanted cell populations from the analysis, and a “DUMP” channel containing antibodies that identify cells of no interest is highly recommended."
"Moreover, using a dot plot with the parameter “time” versus that of interest allows to remove the event bursts caused by clogs or other transient problems during the acquisition."
"The instrument should be kept clean, and it is essential to wash the instrument between acquisitions of different samples in order to minimize sample contamination, which could cause the detection of false positive events.1.3."
"Data analysis Finally, data analysis requires adequate software and powerful hardware (more than 8 GB RAM or higher), because acquired data file tend to be huge, depending on how many events and parameters have been acquired (e.g., ten colors and two scatters in 10 million events are indeed a good test for your computer)."
"To minimize the file size, parameters that are not really needed can be unselected, and a fluorescence/scatter threshold trigger can be used."
"Data analysis will be covered in greater detail in Sections VII.1–2: Data analysis: An overview, Data analysis—Automated analysis: Automated flow cytometry cell population identification and visualization, and Statistics for flow cytometry."
"In conclusion, flow cytometry is at present the most potent technology to address rare cell analysis, and the so called “next generation” instruments with very high speed and sensitivity are already allowing an easy detection and analysis of such cells.2."
"Organisms, cells, organelles, chromosomes, and extracellular vesicles2.1."
Overview Flow cytometry allows information about the structural and chemical characteristics of particles to be measured.
"Although the most common applications of flow cytometry use single mammalian cells, it is also applicable to studies of bacteria, yeast, and viruses as well as whole organisms such as nematodes and Drosophila."
"Conversely, parts of cells such as isolated nuclei, chromosomes, organelles, or extracellular vesicles may also be examined.2.2."
"Organisms Model systems are used to study molecular biology, developmental biology, and neurology and an example of this is the use of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)."
"These organisms are around 1 mm in length, can be cultivated in large numbers, and have a short life cycle that makes them ideal for studying many areas of developmental biology."
Particles of this size are not able to pass through the injection port and flow cell of most cytometers so specifically designed analyzers and sorters are available to identify and separate these organisms [197].
"These large particle sorters can also be used for analyzing and sorting groups of cells such as imaginal discs, pancreatic islets, or embryoid bodies [198, 199].2.3."
"Cells Flow cytometry is perfectly suited for cells that are naturally in suspension, e.g., blood but any multicellular system (cell lines, tissue samples, whole organisms) may be made into single cell suspensions using a variety of mechanical and enzymatic techniques."
"In all cases, there is a balance between creating a good single cell suspension and keeping cell viability high."
It is always important to make sure that measurement exclude dead cells as these will show increased autofluorescence and may bind antibodies and probes non-specifically.
"Exclusion of dead cells may be achieved by adding a viability dye—either a DNA binding dye such as DAPI or Propidium Iodide or an amine-reactive dye, which will bind to proteins [200, 201]."
"Any part of a cell may be labeled with a fluorescent probe but it is important to remember that flow cytometry gives whole cell information, there is no localization of the fluorescence nor any idea about its distribution within the cell."
"To determine the location of fluorescence, an imaging technique is needed, e.g., fluorescence or confocal microscopy or imaging flow cytometry [202].2.4."
"Nuclei Sometimes only the DNA or a nuclear protein is of interest and in these cases, cell nuclei can be produced that often will have less nonspecific binding and therefore a cleaner background."
"Production of nuclei from cells can be achieved in unfixed samples by treating cells with a detergent, e.g., 0.1% Triton-X100, which will lyse cells and release nuclei [203]."
"Or in fixed samples, cells may be treated with an enzyme such as pepsin that will digest the cytoplasm and again release nuclei [204]."
"Isolated nuclei will often give a better CV (coefficient of variation, a measure of data spread) than whole cells, making it easier to discern cell cycle phases.2.5."
Cell organelles Cell organelles within whole cells can be specifically identified by staining them with fluorescent dyes.
These dyes may be fluorochrome-labeled antibodies or fluorescent probes.
"Autophagosomes may be identified by staining with LC3 antibody [205], whereas mitochondria can be stained with Mito-Tracker dyes [206]; lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi can also be identified [207]."
Care must be taken with many dyes that are organelle-specific as the staining time and concentration will be very cell-type dependent and these factors may need to be determined empirically.
Also important when analyzing organelles are controls; not just a negative control to assess background fluorescence but also a positive control to ensure that staining is successful as the majority of these assays involve unfixed samples.
"Also important is building in a kinetic element to experiments, i.e., looking at time points following treatment or stimulation.Cell signaling events are often studied in immunological cells and a common way to do this is to monitor changes in calcium levels that result from the binding of antibodies to surface receptors."
"There are several fluorescent dyes available that can monitor calcium levels such as Indo-1, Fluo-4, and Fura Red [208]."
"Indo-1 is a UV-excited dye that precludes its use in many common flow cytometers but it does have the advantage that it uses a ratio of the bound to unbound calcium signal and is therefore independent of cell size and variability in dye loading.If cell organelles are to be analyzed, in some cases it is better to digest the organelle from the cell."
"It is possible to isolate mitochondria, endocytic vesicles, and endoplasmic reticulum by several methods generally using tissue homogenization [209]."
Such treatment will inevitably lead to some cell loss and a sample that will have a considerable amount of debris.
"However, the selection of dyes combined with light scatter characteristics can allow specific organelles to be identified."
"Although isolated organelles can often result in cleaner staining, the smaller the particle the more problems there will be with co-incident events, i.e., when more than one event is being measured in the flow cell of the cytometer."
"Both in analysis and sorting, the use of light scatter and fluorescence is needed to delineate true particles from background.2.6."
"Chromosomes Although interphase chromosomes cannot be delineated by standard flow cytometry, chromosomes at metaphase may be identified and isolated and this is important in genomic analysis in many animal and plant species [210]."
"Cell division is blocked during metaphase using a drug such as colcemid, chromosomes are isolated following rupture of the cells in a detergent solution and are stained with two DNA binding dyes that have different base-pair specificities [211]."
"In this way, chromosomes may be separated on size and base-pair ratio, Chromomycin A3 (G-C binding) and Hoechst 33258 (A-T binding) is the preferred pair of DNA dyes."
This is an extremely powerful technique but is not widespread as the dyes used require nonstandard excitation wavelengths (355 and 457 nm) and high-powered lasers that are not widely available.
"However, chromosome analysis and sorting is also possible using standard benchtop analyzers or sorters [212]."
"Sample preparation, staining buffer, and cytometer setup are all critical in chromosome analysis.2.7."
"Extracellular vesicles A growth area in cytometric analysis in recent years has been the detection of small particles that encompass exosomes, microparticles, microvesicles, and cell-derived microparticles (including platelets, endothelial, and leukocyte microparticles)."
"Microvesicles are defined as being 100–1000 nm in size [213] compared with exosomes, which are 590 nm), well detectable in healthy cells."
"In the presence of compounds that cause a collapse in mtmP, JC-1 becomes monomer."
"This means that while in healthy cells both green and orange-red fluorescence are expected, cells with depolarized mitochondria display only green fluorescence [234]."
"Considering the shift in fluorescence due to mtmP changes, the best way to display results is that of indicating the percentage of cells with high or low mtmP, rather than the ratio between green and orange-red fluorescence."
"Since 1993, JC-1 has been reported as a reliable membrane potential indicator for several cell types and assay conditions [232, 235, 236], and its compatibility with other fluorescent probes has also been demonstrated in the design of multicolor panels [237, 238]."
"However, the sensitivity of JC-1 toward hydrogen peroxide, its photosensitivity, and the slow rate of equilibration between monomers and aggregates, could partially limit its use."
"Other dyes, similar to JC-1, are also available but are scarcely used."
"JC-9 is characterized by polychromatic fluorescence emission, with excitation at 522 nm, and emission at 535 or 635 nm, in the monomeric or aggregate forms, respectively."
"The green fluorescence of JC-9, characterized by a different chemical structure respect to JC-1, is essentially invariant with membrane potential, whereas the red fluorescence is significantly increased at hyperpolarized membrane potentials."
"JC-10 is excited at 490 nm, and emits at 520 nm (monomeric form) or 590 nm (aggregated form)."
"Compared to JC-1, JC-10 is characterized by higher water solubility and diffuses out of mitochondria in apoptotic and necrotic cells.Mitochondrial mass can be monitored by using dyes able to bind specific mt components regardless of mt polarization status."
"For this reason, the amount of fluorescence is directly proportional to mt content."
"Mito ID and nonyl acridine orange (NAO) bind to cardiolipin in the inner mt membrane, whereas MitoTracker dyes react with the thiol groups of cysteine residues present in mt proteins [239, 240]."
"Some of these dyes, including MitoTracker deep red 633, also form covalent bonds with mt proteins, thus allowing fixation after cell staining."
"As described for TMRE and TMRM, the MdFI relative to the proper channel should be measured for MitoTracker dyes, and the MdFI of the unstained sample should be subtracted to the MdFI of the stained one (Fig."
32).Open in a separate windowFigure 32.MitoTracker Green staining of different subsets of CD8+ T cells.
"Different CD8+ T-cell subsets, i.e., central memory (CM), naïve (N), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated effector memory (EMRA) were identified according to the expression of CD45RA and CD197."
"Among them, the use of MitoTracker Green (MT Green) allows to determine mt mass, which is clearly different among cell subsets.Regarding mt ROS, two fluorescent probes, i.e., MitoSOX red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (MitoSOX) and mitochondria peroxy yellow-1 (mitoPY1), have been recently developed to stain specifically anion superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in mitochondria, respectively [241–243]."
MitoSOX is the mitochondria-targeted form of hydroethidine.
"It accumulates into mitochondria depending on mtmP, and it emits fluorescence upon oxidation and binding to mitochondrial DNA [244]."
"As already reported for other probes, when using MitoSOX and mitoPY1, preparing adequate positive and negative controls is crucial to fully validate the presence of mt H2O2 in biological systems."
"Antimycin A or doxorubicin are best-suited positive controls for MitoSOX staining, whereas exogenous H2O2 or other molecules that increase the fluorescence signal of the probe represent proper positive controls for mitoPY1."
"Negative controls for MitoSOX staining are cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetics or mt uncouplers, depending on the cell type."
"Additional controls can be represented by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine, or other specific scavengers that highly reduce free radical production [245]."
"MitoSOX and mitoPY1 have been tested by flow cytometry for selective quantification of mt anion superoxide and mt hydrogen peroxide in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, several cancer cell lines, among others [246–249]."
The possible simultaneous use of MitoSOX and mitoPY1 in the same panel for the analysis of mt ROS in living cells has also been reported (Fig.
33; [246]).Open in a separate windowFigure 33.MitoSOX Mitochondrial Red superoxide indicator and Mitochondria Peroxy Yellow-1 staining of different subsets of CD8+ T cells.
Doublets were excluded from the analysis of PBMCs by using FCS-A and FSC-H (upper left panel); viable cells were selected according to negativity for annexin-V (ANX-V) Pacific Blue conjugate and TO-PRO-3 iodide (upper right panel).
"Then, CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes were selected on the basis of positivity for a CD4−APC-H7 mAb or a CD8-PO mAb respectively."
"Among these, fluorescence intensity of MitoSOX Mitochondrial Red Superoxide Indicator (MitoSOX) and Mitochondria Peroxy Yellow-1 (mitoPY) was analyzed.Flow cytometry is undoubtedly a useful tool to assay mt functions in biological samples."
"Protocols to assay mt parameters can be applied to several cell models, and are relatively fast, as the time required to complete staining and data analysis (even in the case of multicolor panels) rarely exceeds 3 h. In addition, the analysis of several thousands of cells in a few minutes allows accurate measurements."
"Nevertheless, as a general rule, the use of more than one probe, as well as the use of complementary methods to assess changes in mt membrane potential or mt mass, is strongly recommended.4."
Extracellular vesicles4.1.
"Overview Body fluids contain cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), which can suppress and enhance the immune system and contribute to the development of systemic autoimmune disease."
"To investigate the role of EVs in immunology, flow cytometry (FCM) is the technology of choice for determining the concentration of EVs expressing certain antigens."
"However, because EVs are substantially smaller and dimmer than cells, EV detection and data interpretation are challenging, leading to misconceptions."
"For example, on the one hand, it is often overlooked that FCM does not detect the entire size range of EVs."
"On the other hand, it is often incorrectly thought that FCM is incapable of detecting EVs smaller than the wavelength of light."
"The aim of this section is to briefly address some common misconceptions of EV FCM and to provide recommendations to prevent potential artifacts arising from sample preparation, staining, assay protocol, and data analysis.4.2."
"Introduction Blood and other body fluids contain cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), which is the umbrella term for all types of cell-derived vesicles including microvesicles and exosomes."
"Figure 34A shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of EVs, which can be seen as subcellular cargo containers transporting biomolecules, such as transmembrane receptors and genetic information, to target cells."
"From an immunological perspective, EVs are interesting because EVs transport ligands that can suppress the immune system, enhance the immune response by antigen presentation, and contribute to the development of systemic autoimmune disease [250]."
"See also Chapter V Section 2 Organisms, cells, organelles, chromosomes, and extracellular vesicles.Open in a separate windowFigure 34.Flow cytometry (FCM) detection of extracellular vesicles (EVs)."
(A) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of EVs from human urine after one freeze-thaw cycle [251].
(B) Size distribution of EVs from human urine by TEM [251].
Please note that all graphs have logarithmically scaled vertical axes.
The size distribution has a maximum and follows a power-law distribution for larger EVs.
"For comparison, λ1 and λ2 (dashed lines) indicate illumination wavelengths typically used in FCM."
"(C) Forward scatter (FSC) versus diameter for EVs and platelets exposing integrin β3 (CD61+) from human blood plasma and polystyrene particles measured (symbols) by FCM (A60-Micro, Apogee Flow Systems, UK) and calculated (lines) with Mie theory (Rosetta Calibration, Exometry, the Netherlands) [252]."
"The diameters of EVs, platelets, and polystyrene particles were obtained from the FCM scatter ratio [253], literature values [254], and specifications of the manufacturer, respectively."
"Polystyrene particles were modeled as solid spheres with a refractive index (RI) of 1.633, whereas EVs and platelets were modeled as concentric spheres having a shell with a thickness of 4 nm and an RI of 1.48 and a core with an RI of 1.38."
FSC increases with increasing diameter and refractive index and scatter of polystyrene particles cannot be directly related to the scatter and diameter of EVs.
(D) CD61-APC versus diameter for EVs and platelets exposing CD61+.
"The parabolic fit describes CD61-APC expression of EVs and platelets (R2 = 0.59), meaning that EVs and platelets have a similar density of CD61."
"In (C) and (D), the EV diameter was determined by the FCM scatter ratio [253], whereas the platelet diameter was obtained from the literature [254].4.3."
EV analyses by flow cytometry EV FCM is particularly useful to determine the number concentration of certain EV types in (body) fluids.
"However, the small size of EVs complicates FCM analyses."
Figure 34B shows a size distribution of EVs from human urine based on TEM and resistive pulse sensing.
"General properties of an EV size distribution are a smallest diameter of 50 nm, a peak below 400 nm, and a decreasing concentration with increasing diameter for EVs larger than the peak diameter [251, 255–257]."
"Thus, most EVs are smaller than the illumination wavelength (λ) typically used in FCM."
A general misconception is that EVs smaller than the illumination wavelength cannot be detected by FCM.
"According to the Rayleigh criterion, EVs smaller than roughly half the illumination wavelength cannot be distinguished by classical light microscopy [258]."
"However, even the smallest EVs do scatter light of longer wavelengths and can be detected by FCM, provided that single EVs are illuminated and the flow cytometer has nanoparticle sensitivity."
"In practice, most flow cytometers do not have nanoparticle sensitivity: a recent standardization study showed that only six of 46 tested flow cytometers in the field were able to detect EVs as small as 300 nm [259].To explain how the size of EVs affect their light scattering intensity, Fig."
"34C shows the FSC measured by FCM (A60-Micro, Apogee Flow Systems, UK) versus the diameter of platelet-derived EVs and platelets exposing integrin β3 (CD61) from human plasma and, for comparison, of polystyrene particles."
"The diameters of EVs, platelets, and polystyrene particles were obtained from the FCM scatter ratio [253], literature values [254], and specifications of the manufacturer, respectively."
"Please notice that the scattering intensity of EVs rapidly decreases for small diameters [251, 258, 260, 261] and is substantially lower compared to platelets and similar-sized polystyrene particles [260, 261]."
The low scattering efficiency of EVs implies that a flow cytometer cannot detect EVs as small as the smallest detectable polystyrene beads.The small size of EVs also results in low fluorescence intensities.
Figure 34D shows the fluorescence intensity versus diameter of EVs and platelets labeled with APC CD61 mAb.
The parabolic curve indicates that EVs and platelets have a similar surface density of CD61.
"However, because the surface area scales quadratically with the particle diameter, EVs have much less antigens available to bind APC CD61 mAb than platelets and therefore emit less fluorescence."
The complex size distribution combined with low scatter and fluorescence intensities imply that signals from EVs are close to and/or below the detection limit of FCM.
"Hence, a flow cytometer with the dynamic range to detect all EVs in biological samples does currently not exist.The difficulty of EV FCM is recognized by the EV Flow Cytometry Working Group (evflowcytometry.org), which consists of experts from the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV), International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC), and International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)."
"At present, the working group is compiling a series of consensus manuscripts, which will become a framework that is consistent with the MIFlowCyt guidelines [39]."
"A preliminary outcome is that a general step-by-step protocol for EV FCM does not exist yet, because the optimal procedures depend on the research question, the sample studied, and the flow cytometer used."
The steps below are therefore recommendations for EV FCM experiments with references to articles with detailed protocols and examples.
"This section does not cover imaging FCM, flow sorters, or mass cytometry."
"Based on new insights and reaching consensus in the rapidly evolving EV research field, however, current recommendations will likely become subject to change.4.4."
Step-by-step sample preparation 4.4.1.
"Collection, isolation, and storage Because cells may still release EVs after collection of a (body) fluid, unprocessed fluids are unstable EV samples [262, 263]."
"To obtain stable EV samples, it is common practice to collect the fluid, remove cells, and freeze EV-containing aliquots."
"However, each pre-analytical step will impact the concentration and composition of EVs."
"The optimal protocol depends on the research question, the type of (body) fluid, the type of the EVs of interest, and the used flow cytometer."
"To limit the scope and emphasize differences between pre-analytical variables involved in cell and EV FCM, we will summarize considerations involved in collection and isolation of EVs from human blood for characterization by FCM."
"The considerations are based on ISEV guidelines [264], ISTH guidelines [265], and methodological guidelines to study EVs [262]."
"Considerations for other fluids, such as urine [266] and saliva [267] can be found in the literature [263].4.4.2."
Collection Collect blood from overnight fasting subjects with a 21-gauge needle and avoid prolonged use of a tourniquet [268–271].
"Collect blood in plastic tubes at room temperature and discard the first 2–3 mL of collected blood [272, 273]."
Omit hemolyzed blood samples or interpret results with care [264].
The recommended anticoagulant for FCM analyses is citrate (0.109 mol/L final concentration) [265].
"During transport, minimize vibrations and keep the tubes in a vertical position."
Minimize and standardize the time interval between collection and removal of cells.4.4.3.
"Isolation When preparing serum, EVs are released during the clot formation [262]."
"Therefore, plasma is usually preferred over serum and serum that is used as culture medium should be EV-free."
"To prepare plasma from blood, current guidelines recommend to apply two subsequent centrifugation steps of 2500 × g for 15 min at room temperature [265]."
"Use the lowest or no deceleration, and do not collect the 5 mm of plasma above the buffy coat."
Quantify the number of residual platelets in the platelet-depleted plasma.
"To improve reproducibility, report centrifugation conditions, including deceleration, rotor type, speed, temperature, time, tube type, and volumes in the tubes [274].A misconception about EV FCM is the use of additional highspeed and ultracentrifugation steps to isolate and concentrate EVs of different size (e.g., microvesicles and exosomes)."
"Separating EVs of different sizes is unnecessary because the size of EVs can be determined by FCM based on scatter or fluorescence signals [252, 253, 275]."
Concentrating EVs is unnecessary for all EV samples that require dilution upon FCM analysis.
"A centrifugation washing step or size exclusion chromatography, however, may be useful to decrease the concentration of lipoprotein particles, which overlap in size with EVs, soluble proteins, and unbound reagents [276]."
"The presence of these non-EV particles may cause artifacts, which will be discussed in the next sections about staining and swarm detection.4.4.4."
"Storage Although the stability of EVs during a freeze–thaw cycle and storage warrants further investigation [263], freezing is the most common method to store EVs."
Use vials with a rubber ring and screw lid to minimize cryo-precipitation and to prevent formation of ice crystals.
"Snap-freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen [277], store aliquots at or below −80°C, and thaw aliquots at 37°C [278–280].4.5."
"Staining EVs can be stained with labels available for cells, such as antibodies (Abs; Chapter III, Section 1.1 Controls: Determining positivity by eliminating false positives), membrane dyes, and fluorescent dyes that are used to stain nucleic acids (see V.6 DNA synthesis, cell cycle, and proliferation)."
"EV staining, however, involves different problems and choices and requires more controls than cell staining."
"For example, if a flow cytometer detects smaller and thus more EVs with fluorescence triggering compared to scatter triggering, EVs are preferably stained with a generic EV marker, such as lactadherin."
"However, generic EV markers that specifically detect all and exclusively EVs do not exist [281].When designing experiments for polychromatic FCM, Ab-conjugated fluorochromes should be carefully selected."
"Preferably, use fluorochromes that (i) are readily conjugated to Abs, (ii) have high associated fluorescence intensities (“bright”), and (iii) exhibit little spectral overlap with other fluorochromes [282, 283]."
The use of bright fluorophores increases the SNR of EVs with low antigen exposure (Fig.
"34D), whereas spectral overlap should be reduced because compensation of spectral spill-over is complicated by low signal levels and unstable autofluorescence levels."
The aforementioned restrictions on fluorochromes limit the number of Abs that can be simultaneously measured in typical EV FCM experiments.
"To increase specificity, phallotoxin can be used to differentiate between intact EVs and nonspecific binding of mAb conjugates to damaged membrane fragments [284].Similar to cell analysis, it is good practice to titrate reagents to find the optimal Ab concentration (see III.2 Titration: Determining optimal reagent concentration)."
"To prevent that Ab-aggregates are artifactually counted as EVs, remove Ab-aggregates by centrifugation at 19 000 × g for 5 minutes before staining."
"After staining, reduce the concentration of unbound reagents by washing, size exclusion chromatography, or dilution to reduce sample related noise and thus increase the SNR.4.6."
Assay protocol 4.6.1.
"Swarm detection Before optimizing the acquisition settings, it is important to realize that in most FCM measurements, only a part of the EVs exceed the detection limit [251, 260]."
Due to the complex size distribution of EVs (Fig.
"34B), however, the fraction of EVs below the detection limit may outnumber EVs exceeding the detection limit."
"Consequently, EVs below the detection limit may contribute to the measured signal or even exceed the trigger threshold (see Chapter IV, Section Cell sorting)."
"This special form of coincidence detection is named swarm detection [260, 285]."
Serial dilutions can be used to find the optimal dilution and minimize the effect of swarm detection.
The measured number concentration versus dilution should give a linear decrease and a consistent median fluorescence and scatter intensity.4.6.2.
Acquisition settings The optimal acquisition settings differ between flow cytometers.
"Select settings that lead to the highest sensitivity, and thus detection of the dimmest EVs, while avoiding background noise and swarm detection."
"In general, use the highest illumination power, use the shortest illumination wavelength for scatter detection, select the lowest flow rate, and optimize detector voltages and thresholds (See Chapter IV, Section Cell sorting) [57]."
"The choice whether to trigger on scatter or fluorescence depends on the flow cytometer [281, 286–288]."
"Regarding scatter, SSC is generally more sensitive than FSC, particularly for instruments equipped with a photodiode at FSC [260, 289].4.6.3."
"Controls To verify what events are truly EVs, controls are needed, such as buffer only control, reagents in buffer control, unstained sample control, blocking and isotype control alone or in addition to the related FMO control, serial dilutions, detergent treatment, and sample analyses by techniques complementary to FCM [57].The buffer only control involves periodic measurements of buffer to address sources of noise and monitor the stability of background counts."
"The reagents in buffer control involves the addition of reagents to the buffer at the same concentration as used in the experiment, and to confirm the absence of events caused by the reagents [216, 281, 290]."
"The unstained sample control (see also Chapter V, Section 3 Mitochondria) involves a measurement of unstained EVs and may assist in determining autofluorescence levels and setting gates."
"Blocking and isotype controls can be used to differentiate between specific and nonspecific binding of Abs (Chapter III, Section 1.4 Specificity of reagent for staining target: Blocking and isotype controls), but not to set gates or to correct counts for nonspecificity."
Isotype controls should be used from the same manufacturer and at the same concentration as the respective Ab [291].
"In an FMO control, which is used for experiments with multiple Abs, one reagent is left out or added to the isotype control to determine the fluorescent gate for that reagent (Chapter III, Section 1.2 Fluorescence spreading into the channel of interest: FMO controls).Serial dilutions can minimize the effect of swarm detection, as discussed before."
Detergent treatment involves the lysis of EVs by addition of detergent to check whether events that are supposed to be EVs disappear.
"Results of detergent treatment should be interpreted with care, because other particles than EVs may lyse as well [292] and change in scattering properties due to a refractive index change of the medium [293]."
"For FCM, data from complementary techniques are useful for experimental design."
"For example, the size distribution and concentration measured by resistive pulse sensing may be used to determine the optimal dilution and prevent swarm detection, whereas surface plasmon resonance imaging or a western blot may be used to confirm the presence of certain antigens.4.6.4."
Calibrations FCM provides data in arbitrary units.
"To improve data interpretation and enable data comparison, fluorescence signals can be calibrated in units of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorophore (MESF) or equivalent reference fluorophore (ERF) [294–296] and scatter signals can be calibrated in units of nm2 [252, 259, 260, 297]."
Do not use the scatter intensity of two sizes of polystyrene particles to set gates for two reasons.
"First, polystyrene particles scatter light much more efficiently than similar-sized EVs (Fig."
"34C), which may lead to data misinterpretation."
"For example, an earlier proposed gating strategy based on the scatter intensities of 500 nm and 900 nm polystyrene particles [298, 299] leads to the inclusion of platelets, membrane fragments, and perhaps erythrocyte ghosts [255] instead of the envisioned EVs [260]."
"Second, a gate based on two polystyrene particles selects different EV sizes at different flow cytometers and therefore is not suitable for the purpose of data comparison [259].Statements about the number concentration of EVs also require calibration of the flow rate, especially because the actual flow rate may be 50% lower or 100% higher than the set flow rate [259]."
"The flow rate can be estimated using commercial reference particles with a specified concentration, by mass discharge measurements [259], or by a calibrated flow rate sensor.4.7."
"Materials Materials required for collection, isolation, storage, and staining depend on the experiment."
"Generally, use a clean, filtered buffer and measure the buffer to confirm cleanness."
"Preferably, the flow cytometer is able to detect the scatter intensity of at least 200 nm polystyrene particles and a fluorescence intensity of at least 1000 MESF (see also Fig."
34C and ​andD).D).
"For comparison, one of the most sensitive flow instruments for EV detection today can detect single ~20 nm polystyrene particles and a single PE molecule [300].4.8."
"Data analysis Most data analyses steps can be done with software capable of reading FCM data, creating histograms and scatter plots and applying gates."
"Preferably, start with the aforementioned calibrations of the scatter and fluorescence detectors to obtain data with units that are understandable and comparable."
Use the aforementioned controls to exclude swarm detection and define gates.
Count the number of EVs within the gate during a measurement and use the calibrated flow rate to relate counts to number concentration.
"Because only a part of the EVs can be detected [251, 260], the reported number concentration should be accompanied with the range wherein the EVs are detected."
"For example, in Fig."
"34D we measured a concentration of 4.4 × 108 CD61+ EVs/mL with an APC intensity between 5.0 × 102 and 11.7 × 103 MESF.Because the size, scatter intensity, and fluorescence intensity distributions of EVs are often asymmetrical, the use of statistical parameters such as mean, median, and SD should be used with care."
"To describe the shape of an EV distribution, it is generally more appropriate to use a mathematical function."
"For example, EV size distributions can often be described with a power-law function (Fig."
"34B), log-normal function, or exponential decay.New, sophisticated procedures exist to derive the diameter of EVs from scatter or fluorescence signals."
"For example, Exometry offers a commercial kit and the National Institute of Health offers free software [301] to determine the EV diameter from a single scatter detector."
"The information from two scatter detectors can be combined to determine the refractive index, which can be used for label-free differentiation between EVs and lipoprotein particles [253].To ensure reproducibility, all details involved in sample collection, isolation, storage, staining, data acquisition, controls, calibrations, and data analyses such as gating (Chapter VI, Section 3 Analysis presentation and publication (MIFlowCyt)) should be reported."
Graphs should have clear axes labels and calibrated scales and reported values of the fluorescence intensity and scattering intensity preferably have comparable units.
"Data sharing via public repositories is highly recommended (See Chapter VII, Section 4 Data repositories: Sharing your data).4.9."
"Pitfalls Detecting artifacts, such as swarm detection and background noise, instead of single EVs.Using the scatter intensity of two sizes of polystyrene particles to gate EVs.Providing the concentration of EVs without reporting the dynamic range of the detector(s) in standardized, comparable units.Using high-speed and ultracentrifugation steps to isolate and concentrate EVs of different size (e.g., microvesicles and exosomes) upon FCM analyses.4.10."
"Top tricks Realize that FCM measures only a part of all EVs in the sample.Quantify which EVs the flow cytometer can measure and map out related artifacts.Use controls to verify detection of the envisioned, single EVs.Report (1) the research question and hypotheses, (2) all details of the protocol required to reproduce the data, and (3) data values in standardized, comparable units.5."
Surface parameters5.1.
Overview This section focuses on the handling of suspension cells and cells obtained enzymatically from tissue samples for the detection of cell surface molecules.
"Although this is the most commonly used application in flow and mass cytometry, some pitfalls during sample handling, staining, and data analysis can occur, which will be discussed here.5.2."
"Introduction Surface molecules comprise membrane proteins, such as receptors, enzymes, ion channels, adhesion, and transporter molecules, lipids, or polysaccharides but also external ligands, either specifically loaded onto their specific receptors, e.g., cytokines or Abs or nonspecifically attached to the cell surface (reviewed in ref."
[302]).
"These molecules are easily accessible by FCM and do not typically require special preparation of cells, such as fixation or permeabilization."
"Most surface markers, in particular those known as lineage markers, are also expressed at reasonable density allowing clear-cut discrimination between positively and negatively stained cells.In principle, surface molecules can be detected with different types of labels in a range of affinities, such as Abs, receptor ligands, lectins for the detection of glycan structures, annexin V for the detection of phosphatidylserine at the outer membrane of apoptotic cells (see Chapter V Section 7: Measuring cell death mechanisms) and complex multivalent reagents, e.g., for increased binding avidity, e.g., MHC/peptide-tetramers (see Chapter V Sections 17.3–17.5: Antigen-specific T-cell cytometry), which in general are chemically conjugated to fluorescent reporter molecules.5.3."
"Minimize artifacts by minimal cell manipulation If possible, surface molecules should be stained on live cells to avoid any kind of antigen denaturation possibly introduced by pre-treatment steps, such as cell fixation or cell permeabilization, to clearly differentiate between intra- and extracellular localization."
"For combined intracellular (see also Chapter V Section 14 Intracellular parameters) and surface staining, surface markers should be stained first, followed by fixation and permeabilization before staining for intracellular antigens."
"Defined reagents such as recombinant Abs [303] with reduced “nonspecific” interactions should be used whenever possible (see also Chapter III Section 1, Controls: Determining positivity by eliminating false positives) especially when cells do express high or low affinity Ig Fc receptors, such as CD64 or CD32."
"Unspecific, Fc receptor-mediated binding of immunoglobulins can be suppressed by incubating cells in the presence of blocking reagents, such as purified Igs.In contrast to blood cells or cells from liquid exudates, primary cells located in tissues often require an enzymatic pretreatment for tissue dissociation to finally obtain cells in suspension (see Chapter III Section 3)."
But during this procedure antigenicity of surface proteins can be also affected.
"Therefore, depending from the tissue type and cells of interest, conditions for enzymatic digestions have to be carefully established."
"In general, there are a variety of enzymes available, such as elastase, hyaluronidase, dispase, and different types of collagenases."
"They differ in their digestive characteristics and, therefore, incubation time, temperature, and concentration of enzymes have to be optimized with respect to cell viability, cell yield, and preservation of antigens that will be investigated by FCM."
"In the case of very sensitive antigens, which are destroyed during tissue digestion, isolated cells may be cultured over night to allow re-expression of affected cell surface proteins."
"Principally, cells obtained after enzymatically tissue digestion are much more stressed than suspension cells and therefore, require the identification of dead cells and their exclusion from the analysis as described in Chapter III, Section 4: Dead cell exclusion, cell viability, and sample freezing."
"As described there, dead cells will increase background signals due to a general increase in autofluorescence or due to the increased unspecific binding of staining reagents.A very detailed protocol to isolate thymic epithelial cells is given by Jain and Gray [304] and for human skin mast cells by Grützkau et al."
[305].
"Moreover, The tissue dissociation guide from Worthington summarizes all aspects of tissue dissociation in a very comprehensive way (Worthington Biochemical Corporation Tissue Dissociation Guide [306]).Although flow cytometric analyses should ideally be performed with fresh samples, there are several possibilities to stabilize cells or blood samples before preparation for FCM (see also Chapter III, Section 3: Preparation of single-cell suspensions; Section 4: Dead cell exclusion, cell viability, and sample freezing; and Section 5: Cell fixation and permeabilization for flow cytometry)."
Short-term preservation of blood for up to 24 h by Ficoll 70 kDa is mainly aiming at inhibiting blood settling-induced stress that is caused by RBC aggregation [307].
"For long-term storage, the cryopreservation of PBMCs is another option."
"But it should to be kept in mind that some surface molecules, like CD62L or chemokine receptors in general, can be negatively affected by this procedure."
"In addition, some cell types may be more sensitive to this type of treatment, which has to be determined individually for each cell population of interest.In addition, there are several commercial reagents available, that can be used for long-term storage of blood samples, such as TransFix (CYTOMARK, Caltag Medsystems, Buckingham, UK), Cyto-Chex BCT (Streck, Omaha, US) and Smart Tube (Smart Tube, San Carlos, CA) [308]."
"The latter one even allows analyzing frozen blood samples after appropriate treatment without losing granulocytes.But for all these stabilizing protocols, it is strongly recommended that they have thoroughly been validated for the surface markers of interest.Live cells may be sensitive to prolonged in vitro handling procedures or may actively internalize surface molecules or shed them from the surface, e.g., after labeling with Abs."
"This can be avoided by gentle treatment, e.g., careful pipetting, short handling time, low temperature (on ice), or addition of sodium azide to the staining buffers, which blocks active shedding/internalization."
"After staining, cells should be immediately analyzed or strictly be kept on ice and in the dark to avoid photobleaching.For the detection and analysis of cell subsets that are detectable only in very low frequencies (4Open in a separate windowBrdU, 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine6.3."
"DNA synthesis—Nucleotide incorporation Analogous to the measurement of proliferation based on 3H-thymidine incorporation, cell division can be monitored by FCM using 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a synthetic nucleoside analogue of thymidine."
"For this, BrdU is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA of replicating cells (during the S phase of the cell cycle), and its incorporation detected using conjugated Abs specific for BrdU, which are widely available from a number of commercial sources."
"Binding of the Ab requires denaturation of the DNA, usually by exposing the cells to acid or heat."
"The measurement of BrdU is typically undertaken in conjunction with viability dyes and/or DNA stains for cell cycle analysis.Although appearing to be a straightforward assay, sample preparation and DNA denaturation for BrdU-based measurements of cell division must be performed carefully, as too little treatment will result in a low signal and too much treatment will influence the DNA and the signal that is generated."
"Samples need to be washed well (at least three times), as any residual acid will denature the detecting Ab."
"Furthermore, BrdU is labile even at 4°C and so must be used fresh."
A typical experimental protocol producing a typical staining profile (Fig.
37) involves the following:Open in a separate windowFigure 37.Schematic representation of fluorescent dot plot for the flow cytometric analysis of cell proliferation based on BrDU incorporation.
"Human PBMCs have been labeled with BrDU and a phenotypic marker, with unlabeled cells acting as the control."
"The total viable cell population was used for the analysis.Incubate cells with BrdU (~10 μM) for 30–60 minFix harvested and pelleted cells by suspending in ice-cold 70% v/v ethanol at 4°C for at least 30 min (samples can be left for up to 7 days).Pellet cells, wash in PBS and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT) (with occasional mixing) in freshly prepared 2 M HCl.Wash cells twice in PBS, and then in PBS-Tween (PBS containing 0.1% w/v BSA and 0.2% v/v Tween 20, pH 7.4).Add an appropriate amount of anti-BrdU mAb (conjugated/unconjugated), as determined by titration experiments, to the cell pellet and incubate samples at RT for 20 min in the dark (BrdU is photo-unstable).Wash samples twice in PBS-Tween and, if an unconjugated mAb has been used, incubate samples with an appropriate secondary Ab at RT for 20–30 minutes.After washing in PBS, incubate cell pellets with RNAse (50 μL, 100 mg/ml) for 15 min at RT or 37°C.Add an appropriate volume of the required viability stain (e.g., PI, 200 μL, 50 mg/mL).Analyze the viable cell populations(s) by FCM, collecting a minimum of 10 000 relevant events per sample.An alternative to BrdU is the modified nucleoside, EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine)."
"Assays such as the Molecular Probes™ Click-iT™ EdU cell proliferation assay are based on the labeling of proliferating cells with a bright, photostable Alexa Fluor® dye in a fast, highly specific click reaction."
"Unlike BrdU assays, EdU assays are not Ab -based and therefore do not require DNA denaturation for the detection of the incorporated nucleoside."
"Click-iT™ EdU can also easily be multiplexed with fluorescent proteins like R-PE, R-PE tandems, and green fluorescent protein."
Only a mild fixation and detergent permeabilization is sufficient for the small molecule-based Click-iT™ EdU detection reagent to gain access to the DNA.
"A typical experimental protocol producing a typical staining profile and improved DNA histograms has previously been reported [318, 319].6.4."
Dye dilution The essence of dye dilution approaches is that cells are labeled with fluorescent dyes that intercalate into the cells such that the dye is approximately equally distributed between the two daughter cells following division.
"As the cell divides, the dye is diluted out and by counting the peaks (or modeling the pattern) the number of original dividing cells can be calculated (Fig."
38).Open in a separate windowFigure 38.Schematic fluorescence histogram depicting a progressive decline in the fluorescent intensity of proliferating cells stained with CFSE.
"For the assays, 106 isolated cells (e.g., human PBMCs) are incubated with CFSE (~5 mM final concentration) at room temperature for 8 min, at which time the reaction is blocked by the addition of FBS (2% v/v final concentration)."
"Cells are washed in PBS containing 2% v/v FBS, after which they are stimulated."
The fluorescence of the stimulated cells is then measured at appropriate time-points using FCM.
"(A) The bright/strong, undiluted fluorescent signal of nonproliferating/arrested cells."
"(B) The (serially) diluted fluorescence intensity of cell populations from successive generations of proliferated cells.As originally described in 1994 by Lyons and Parish [320], cells were stained with the protein-binding, amino-reactive dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)."
"One limitation of CFSE is that there is a proliferation-independent loss of fluorescence in the first 24–36 h, and therefore, this must be considered during the analysis and interpretation of the data."
"Although alternatives for which there is no loss of signaling after labeling include membrane-labeling lipophilic dyes that include the PKH2 (green), PKH67 (green), PKH26 (orange), and CellVue™ claret (far red) dyes from Sigma–Aldrich, these are more suitable for cell tracking experiments."
"More suitable for dye dilution studies are protein-binding dyes such as the CellTrace™ range from Molecular Probes®, the eFluor® Cell Proliferation dyes from eBioscience, the BD Horizon™ dyes from BD Biosciences and the Tag-it Violet™ Proliferation and Cell Tracking Dye from BioLegend."
"If cells require fixing, then it is important to avoid organic solvents when using membrane dyes."
"It is also important to use the correct dilution of dyes, as they can have adverse effects on cell viability and function."
Use the highest concentration that does not induce such negative effects for a given cell number.
"Protocols for the staining and analysis approaches can be accessed from the many suppliers of the reagents that are being used.As with all experiments, it is essential to include the relevant negative and positive controls."
"Moreover, once the instrument settings have been optimized, it is important to place unstimulated cells at the highest decade on the fluorescence plot."
"Nonviable cells should be excluded, as they lose the dye as they enter apoptosis."
Doublets should be excluded as a doublet of two cells in the G0 /G1 phase would exhibit the same fluorescence intensity on a DNA stain as a single cell in the G2/M phase.
G0/G1 doublets would therefore create false positive results for G2/M cells [321].
"Furthermore, a doublet formed between a positive and negative cell would be seen as being positive during a cell sort, as a consequence of which the sort would be contaminated with negative cells."
"The presence of doublets would also cause problems for DNA content/ploidy analyses and could lead to misinterpretation of double positives during immunophenotyping studies, in that a double positive cell could in fact be a mixed doublet of two individually positive cells.Useful ResourcesBitesizeBio Flow Cytometry Channel (http://bitesizebio.com/category/technical-channels/flow-cytometry)Chromocyte Limited: Resource for FCM and cell-based assays (www.chromocyte.com)European Society for Clinical Cell Analysis (ESCCA, www.escca.eu)Expert Cytometry: Flow cytometry training (www.expertcytometry.com)International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC, http://isac-net.org)Purdue University Cytometry Laboratories (www.cyto.purdue.edu)7."
Measuring cell death mechanisms7.1.
"Apoptosis: Measurement of apoptosis The above approaches for identifying the induction and presence of cell death are based on the loss or maintenance of membrane integrity, and thereby reflect cellular necrosis."
They provide little insight into the nature of that cell death.
"In instances where the induction of cell death is a primary endpoint of the experiment, interrogating changes in the plasma membrane provides an opportunity to generate insight into the mechanisms that are involved."
By far the most common approach is to determine the induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death).
Apoptosis is a tightly controlled and programmed pattern of cell death that is required for the maintenance of normal cell growth and development.
Defective apoptosis can result in abnormal development and pathogenesis.
"Understanding cell death mechanism(s) is important, as the mode of cell death (necrosis vs. apoptosis) can influence the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses that cell death can induce."
"The importance of this area was recognized by the award of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Sydney Brenner, H. Robert Horvitz, and John E. Sulston “for their discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death.”During early apoptosis, phosphatidylserine (PS) is translocated from the cytosolic side of the intact plasma membrane to the extracellular surface."
Early apoptotic cells cannot therefore be reliably identified using approaches that are based on membrane permeability.
"Annexin V belongs to a family of proteins consisting of over 160 members, and has high affinity, specificity, and sensitivity for PS."
"Thus, the binding of annexin V to cells can be used as a marker of early apoptosis [322]."
"In order to rule out “leaky” necrotic cells, annexin V staining must always be used in conjunction with reagents that determine the integrity of the cell membrane, such as PI or 7-AAD."
"Of course, such assays cannot be performed using fixed cells.Although the protocols for such assays are relatively straightforward, they should be undertaken according to the instructions provided by the supplier of the reagents."
"This is especially important in the case of Annexin V binding, as all Annexin family members share the same characteristics of Ca2+-dependent binding to negatively charged phospholipid surfaces."
"It is essential that the correct staining buffers are used, as changing or variations in Ca2+ ion concentrations can have dramatic effects on the staining profiles."
"Furthermore, the binding of Annexin V to PS is reversible, and so samples must be analyzed as soon as possible (typically 1–3 h after labeling), using a consistent and reproducible protocol."
A typical experimental protocol producing a typical staining profile (Fig.
"39; [323, 324]) involves the following:Open in a separate windowFigure 39.Identifying healthy and apoptotic cells based on Annexin V staining."
The human prostate cancer cell line LNCap was seeded into six-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight.
"The following day, cells were left untreated (A) or incubated for 6 h with 4 μg/mL human recombinant granzyme B [323, 324] (B)."
"After the incubation period, cells were harvested and processed as described above, with 105 cells being stained with Alexa-Fluor® 647 Annexin V (following the manufacturer's instructions) and PI (final concentration 1 μg/mL)."
Cells were analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Gallios™ flow cytometer.
"Plotting Annexin V binding on the x-axis of a 2D dot/density plot and PI/7-AAD on the y-axis enables the identification of healthy (Annexin VnegativePI/7-AADnegative, bottom left quadrant), apoptotic (Annexin VpositivePI/7-AADnegative, bottom right quadrant) and late apoptotic/dead (Annexin VpositivePI/7-AADpositive, top right quadrant) cells."
"The cells incubated in the presence of granzyme B showed induction of apoptosis and increased cell death.Wash cells (1 × 105) in Annexin V Binding Buffer (PBS containing 10% v/v FCS, 1.0 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 mM CaCl2);Pellet cells (5 min, 400 × g), remove the supernatant, either by decanting or vacuum aspiration and resuspend cells in 100 μL of Annexin V Binding Buffer;Incubate cells with an appropriate volume (e.g., 5 μL) of fluorescently-conjugated Annexin V (e.g., Alexa Fluor™ 647-Annexin V, Biolegend), vortex mix in order to ensure even distribution of the stain) for 15 min at room temperature while protected from light;Wash cells in Annexin V Binding Buffer and resuspend cells in 250 μL fresh buffer;Transfer cells to 12 × 75mm polypropylene tubes, stored on ice protected from light before being analyzed by flow cytometry;Immediately prior to analysis, add DNA-binding dye (PI: 5 μL, 200 μg/mL, 7-AAD: 4 μL, 250 μg/mL] to allow identification, and exclusion, of any nonviable cells.Although Annexin V staining is probably the most commonly used approach used for determining apoptosis, others can be used."
"For instance, the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method involves labeling the ends of DNA breaks with dUTP using TdT."
These labeled breaks can then be detected using an anti-BrdU antibody.
"In this case, fixation is required."
"However, given that this approach depends on DNA damage rather than staining actual components of the apoptotic pathway, it can be insensitive."
"Another alternative to the Annexin V assay is the Violet Ratiometric Membrane Asymmetry Probe, F2N12S from ThermoFisher."
This probe is excitable at 405 nm and detects variations in surface charge associated with PS flipping.
"Viable cells produce an orange emission that shifts to green with apoptosis, resulting in a decreased orange/green emission ratio.The later stages of apoptosis involve chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, a consequence of which is that the nuclei of apoptotic cells become smaller than those of viable cells and display higher fluorescence when labeled with dyes such as UV excited Hoechst 33342 (which is available from a number of suppliers and is also excited at 405 nm) or 405 nm-excited Vybrant™-DyeCycle™ Violet stains (ThermoFisher)."
"When paired with an impermeable dead cell stain, it is possible to distinguish live, apoptotic, and necrotic cell populations using such chromatin condensation assays.The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is another hallmark of early apoptosis [325]."
"In cells undergoing apoptosis, the mitochondria will release cytochrome C and the apoptosis inducing factor—both of which are necessary for caspase activation (yet another critical step in apoptosis)."
"It is also possible to assess apoptosis based on mitochondrial membrane polarization using fluorescent dyes such as JC-1 (5,5_,6,6_-tetrachloro- 1,1_,3,3_-tetraethyl-benzimidazol-carbocyanine) or JC-10 that can be obtained from a number of different suppliers."
"As the mitochondrial potential is lost during apoptosis, the emission shifts from red to green, thereby resulting in a decreased red/green fluorescence ratio."
"The principle of this approach is that the dye accumulates in healthy mitochondria, in which it is present as a multimer."
"Upon disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, the dye is released, and changes color due to it transforming into a monomer in the cytoplasm.DiIC1(5) (1,1_3,3,3_3_-hexamethylindocarbocynanine iodide) is another positively charged dye that accumulates in active mitochondria."
It is excited at 635 nm and is read in the APC channel (peak emission 658 nm).
The fluorescence intensity of DiIC1(5) decreases as membrane potential is lost.
"MitoTracker Red CMXRos is another useful mitochondrial probe that is optimally excited at 561 nm, and to a lesser extent 488 nm, and read in the phycoerythrin (PE) channel (peak emission 599 nm)."
"CMXRos also shows a decrease of fluorescence as membrane potential is lost.A key issue to be aware of is that the sample preparation process can all lead to preferential loss of apoptotic cells during sample preparation (i.e., prolonged trypsinization, mechanical or enzymatic disaggregation from tissues, centrifugation steps)."
It is therefore important to collect cells that have been released into the media when experimenting with adherent cell cultures.
Density gradient separation of cells can also selectively deplete apoptotic cells due to differing relative densities.7.2.
Apoptosis: Caspase activation A distinctive feature of the early stages of apoptosis is the activation of caspase enzymes.
The caspases constitute a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases that cleave protein substrates at specific amino acid residues.
"This triggers a sequence of cleavage events, including the cleavage of other caspases, and generates a caspase signaling cascade that leads to apoptosis."
"In mammals, the “initiator” caspases-2, −8, −9, −10, and −12 are closely coupled to upstream, pro-apoptotic signals, and cleave and activate downstream effector or “executioner” caspases-3, −6, and −7 that modify the proteins that ultimately drive apoptosis [326, 327]."
"In most cases, caspase activation is one of the earliest measurable markers of the apoptotic cascade, and precedes the induction of cell permeability, DNA fragmentation, cytoskeletal collapse, and the “flipping” of PS."
"The pivotal and early involvement of mitochondria and caspases in cell death events has prompted the development of several assays that can be applied alone, or in conjunction with assays for detecting other aspects of the cell death process [325, 328]."
Several commercial suppliers provide validated assays for the detection of apoptosis based on caspase activation.Caspase activation assays can involve the intracellular staining of cell populations using mAbs that are specific for the activated forms of the relevant caspase (Fig.
"40), or can employ small inhibitor peptides conjugated to a fluorophore that specifically target the active site of the chosen caspase.Open in a separate windowFigure 40.Identifying healthy and apoptotic cells based on the expression of activated caspase-3."
The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was seeded into six-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight.
"The next day, cells were left untreated or incubated for 24 h with the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (4 μg/mL, induces apoptosis)."
"After the incubation period, cells were harvested and stained using the FITC active caspase-3 apoptosis kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed on a BD Biosciences LSRII flow cytometer."
"Cells were identified using FSc and SSc measurements (A) and the expression of active caspase-3 determined on the basis of FITC fluorescence (B; control sample shown on open histogram and camptothecin treated shown on grey histogram).The cells incubated in the presence of camptothecin showed activation of caspase-3As an example, the CellEvent™ Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent from ThermoFisher is a cell-permeable reagent consisting of a four-amino acid peptide (DEVD) conjugated to a nucleic acid-binding dye."
"The activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 proteins enables them to cleave the caspase 3/7 recognition sequence, which is encoded in the DEVD peptide."
"Cleavage of the recognition sequence and binding of DNA by the reagent labels the apoptotic cells with a bright, fluorogenic signal that has absorption/emission maxima of 511/533 nm."
"When used together with the SYTOX™ AADvanced™ Dead Cell Stain, apoptotic cells can be easily discriminated from live and necrotic cells.Caspase activity can also be determined using the PhiPhiLux™ system, which employs a nonfluorescent substrate for the enzyme that yields a fluorescent product if the enzyme is active."
"The PhiPhiLux™ caspase substrates are cell permeable, demonstrate relatively good caspase specificity, possess high SNRs between their uncleaved and cleaved forms, and have fluorescence spectral properties that are compatible with other fluorescent probes."
"ApoStat (R&D Systems) identifies and quantifies caspase activity in apoptotic cells by irreversibly labeling cells with a cell permeable, FITC-conjugated pan-caspase inhibitor (ApoStat)."
"Any unbound reagent diffuses out of the cell and is washed away, with an increased fluorescence being indicative of caspase activity."
"The CaspGLOW™ staining system detects active caspase-9 in mammalian cells using FITC-conjugated LEHD-fluoromethyl ketone, a specific inhibitor of caspase-9, which is cell permeable and irreversibly binds to the active enzyme.Another approach involves the use of a fluorescently labeled inhibitor peptide that binds to the active site of the caspase or FLICA™—Fluorescent-Labeled Inhibitor Caspase."
"FLICA™ probe based assays, which are available from a number of suppliers, are composed of an affinity peptide inhibitor sequence, a fluoromethyl ketone moiety that facilitates an irreversible binding event with the activated caspase enzyme, and a fluorescent tag reporter."
"The FLICA™ are therefore retained in apoptotic cells, but not in non-apoptotic cells following washing."
"Necrotic and late apoptotic cells can be concurrently identified in green FLICA™-labeled cells using red fluorescent dyes such as PI or 7-AAD, or the far red dye DRAQ7™."
"The ability to measure three apoptotic phenotypes in a single assay provides a powerful and comprehensive view of the apoptotic process, applicable to both suspension cells by traditional flow cytometry.The approach selected for measuring cell viability, cell death, and apoptosis will very much depend on the experimental question, the supplier of the reagents, and the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses for each assay."
"Conventional internet searches will readily identify the plethora of kits and approaches that can be used for measuring caspase activation.Useful resources: See the “Useful resources” in DNA synthesis, cell cycle, and proliferation7.3."
Necroptosis 7.3.1.
"Overview Necroptosis is a form of cell death defined by phosphorylation of the proteins mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), induction of the RIPK3/MLKL complex, oligomerization of MLKL, and membrane translocation of MLKL."
"Currently, none of these biomarkers can be directly and unequivocally determined by FCM, which may make a section on necroptosis in these guidelines seem foolhardy; however, once necroptosis has been validated by, e.g., Western blot identification of the necroptosis-specific biomarkers, FCM can be used for analysis of cells treated under the same necroptosis-inducing conditions."
"Here, we discuss current and future options to detect necroptosis by FCM."
"We also present an easy and straightforward example protocol using differences in DNA fragmentation to discriminate necroptosis from apoptosis as a potential application of FCM to cell death assessment, although it should be noted that this method still requires that necroptosis be validated by alternative methods.7.3.2."
"Introduction By definition of the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death, necroptosis is “a type of regulated cell death triggered by perturbations of extracellular or intracellular homeostasis that critically depends on MLKL, RIPK3, and (at least in some settings) on the kinase activity of RIPK1” [329]."
"In contrast to apoptosis, necroptosis culminates in the rupture of the cell membrane and is associated with the release of intracellular danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and a strong inflammatory phenotype."
"As a consequence, necroptotic cell death has been linked to diseases such as kidney and cardiac injury, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, stroke, and cancer [330, 331]."
"Physiologically, necroptosis contributes to immunosurveillance through the stimulation of innate and adaptive immune responses that target malignant and infectious threats [330, 332]."
"Furthermore, necroptosis ensures the elimination of potentially defective organisms before parturition, thereby contributing to developmental safeguard programs, and is involved in the maintenance of adult T-cell homeostasis [333].At the molecular level, all triggers of necroptosis (such as death receptors, pathogen recognition receptors, or the receptor for type I IFNs) invariably induce the activation of RIPK3."
"This is accomplished via proteins that contain an RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), i.e., RIPK1, TRIF, or DAI."
"The RHIM-mediated interaction of RIPK1, TRIF, or DAI with RIPK3 causes oligomerization, activation, and phosphorylation of RIPK3 at S227 (in humans) or S232 (in mice)."
"Phosphorylated RIPK3 subsequently binds to the second essential core protein of necroptosis, MLKL, and phosphorylates MLKL at T357/S358 (in humans) or S345 (in mice)."
"This results in oligomerization, translocation, and probably insertion of MLKL into the plasma membrane where it elicits rupture of the plasma membrane [332]."
"Inhibitors of necroptosis can prevent this process, e.g., necrostatin-1s (RIPK1 inhibitor), GSK'840, GSK'843, GSK'872 (RIPK3 inhibitors), or necrosulfonamide (targets human, but not mouse MLKL) [334], and sometimes can even switch necroptotic cell death back to apoptosis, although this switch mainly applies to the RIPK3 inhibitors [335]."
"Of note, caspase-8 has been identified as a physiologic negative regulator of necroptosis, supposedly by cleaving and inactivating RIPK1 [336], RIPK3 [337], and the deubiquitinase CYLD [338]."
"As a consequence, interference with the enzymatic activity of caspase-8, e.g., by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), Q-VD-OPh, or Emricasan, will not only inhibit apoptosis, but concurrently also enhance necroptosis [331]."
"As a side note, although mitochondria and ROS have been implicated in necroptosis [339], they are not essential components [340] and a failure to detect ROS by FCM does not necessarily rule out necroptosis."
"Therefore, we do not further discuss the flow cytometric measurement of mitochondrially derived ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction here.At present, the only factors common and specific for all triggers of necroptosis are phosphorylation of MLKL and RIPK3, formation of the RIPK3/MLKL complex, oligomerization of MLKL, and membrane translocation of MLKL [341]."
"Therefore, any FCM protocol aiming to deliver definite proof of necroptosis would have to unequivocally demonstrate the appearance of one or more of these biomarkers."
"Unfortunately, none of currently available protocols fulfills this requirement."
"To detect phosphorylation of MLKL and RIPK3, the current method of choice is Western blot with Abs that recognize phospho-T357/S358 or phospho-S345 in humans or mouse MLKL and phospho-S227 or phospho-S232 in humans or mouse RIPK3 [342]."
"The direct analysis of RIPK3 and MLKL phosphorylation status by FCM may become an option in the future, e.g., by adaptation of the BD Phosflow™ protocol."
"This will, however, require appropriate Abs for detection of pMLKL and pRIPK3 under near-native conditions (i.e., intracellular staining, see Chapter III: “Before you start: Reagent and sample preparation, experimental design”, Section 5: “Cell fixation and permeabilization for flow cytometric analyses”), which, to the best of our knowledge, are currently not available."
"Likewise, formation of the RIPK3/MLKL complex is generally determined by immunoprecipitation analyses, proof of MLKL oligomerization requires separation of the oligomers on nonreducing gels followed by Western blot analyses, and evidence for membrane translocation of MLKL is best obtained by immunostaining analyses or cell fractionation followed by Western blots [341] rather than by flow cytometric assays.Nevertheless, once it has been established by one or more of the above assays that a particular treatment indeed induces necroptosis in a specific cell system, FCM can serve as an easy and fast method to detect and quantify the death of cells subjected to the same treatment."
"Today, FCM is routinely used by hundreds of laboratories worldwide to assess loss of membrane integrity after treatment with necroptotic stimuli."
"The protocol is usually identical to that used to detect apoptotic cells (see Chapter V: “Biological Applications,” Section 7.1 “Apoptosis: Measurement of apoptosis”), except that the cells are treated under conditions that prevent apoptosis, e.g., in the presence of zVAD-fmk."
"Notably, by inhibiting caspase-8, zVAD-fmk will not only block apoptosis but concurrently enhance necroptosis."
"Furthermore, parallel staining for PS externalization can be omitted since studies have recently demonstrated that PS externalization can no longer be regarded as a reliable marker to differentiate between apoptosis and necroptosis because PS is also externalized in necroptotic cells prior to loss of membrane integrity [343, 344]."
"Instead, parallel measurements of samples additionally treated with inhibitors of necroptosis (e.g., necrostatin-1s, GSK'840, GSK'843, GSK'872, or necrosulfonamide) or flow cytometric exclusion of apoptotic caspase-3 activity (e.g., via the BD FITC Active Caspase-3 Apoptosis Kit) can ensure that cells positive for stains such as PI, 7-AAD, or DRAQ7 (i.e., showing loss of membrane integrity) are indeed necroptotic.In addition to this straightforward approach, further protocols have been developed to assess necroptosis by FCM but they, like those noted above, have caveats."
"Lee and co-workers have recently described the simultaneous flow cytometric immunophenotyping of necroptosis, apoptosis, and RIPK1-dependent apoptosis, employing fluorescently tagged Abs that target RIPK3 and active caspase-3 in combination with a fixable live dead fluorescent dye [345]."
"This assay scores cells that show upregulation of RIPK3 as necroptotic; however, Moriwaki et al."
"have recently shown that RIPK3 has necroptosis- and kinase-independent functions in promoting reparative cytokine expression in tissue repair [346] and, therefore, detecting upregulation of RIPK3 by itself is not unequivocal evidence for necroptosis."
Pietkiewicz et al.
[347] have developed an approach that uses a combination of imaging flow cytometry with classical Annexin V/PI staining.
"Their protocol uses image-based analysis of nuclear morphology to differentiate between secondary necrotic/late apoptotic and necroptotic cells, a distinction that cannot be achieved by mere flow cytometric measurement of PS exposure and loss of membrane integrity [343, 347]."
The comparison of the morphology of ANX-V/PI double positive cells using imaging flow cytometry [347] or the difference in kinetics of ANX-V exposure using live microscopy [343] could be used in the future to differentiate apoptosis and necroptosis.
"However, not every laboratory has access to an imaging flow cytometer limiting the applicability of this approach.We detail below an easy and straightforward protocol to detect necroptosis by conventional FCM, although this still needs the validation step of an alternative method for necroptosis confirmation."
This protocol takes advantage of the fact that the DNA fragmentation caused by caspase activation in apoptotic cells does not occur in necroptotic cells [348].
"Therefore, necroptosis and apoptosis can be discriminated via simple cell cycle analysis (i.e., detection of the fraction of hypodiploid (sub-G1) cells, see also Chapter V: “Biological Applications,” Section 6.1: “DNA synthesis and cell cycle analysis”)."
"Necroptotic, in contrast to apoptotic, cells do not show DNA fragmentation as detected in the cell cycle profile as sub-G1 cells (Fig."
41A).
"In parallel, PI staining can be used to verify loss of membrane integrity (Fig."
41B).
"We want to stress that although the protocol below is given for a specific setting ((TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced necroptosis in human BxPC-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells), it can easily be adapted to any cell line/type and treatment that elicits necroptosis.Open in a separate windowFigure 41."
(A) BxPC-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were left untreated (top) or stimulated to elicit apoptosis (middle) or necroptosis (bottom).
The left panels show dot plots of cell size (FSC-H) versus granularity (SSC-H) (relevant cell populations gated as gate A).
The middle panels show dot plots of Pulse Width versus Pulse Area of the PI fluorescence channel to gate for singlets (gate B).
"The right panels depict the respective cell cycle profiles, with percentages of hypodiploid (sub-G1) cells indicated."
(B) BxPC-3 cells were treated as in A and analyzed for loss of membrane integrity by PI staining.
The percentages of PI-negative and PI-positive cells are indicated in the lower and upper right corners of the dot plots.The protocol for cell cycle staining described here is an alternative protocol that we have applied successfully for other cell types revealing a satisfactory resolution of the cell cycle profile [349–351].
"However, we point out that an incubation of at least 24 h at −20°C after the addition of 100% v/v ethanol or using a final concentration of 70% v/v instead of 50% v/v ethanol may improve the resolution of the cell cycle profiles if required.7.3.3."
"Step-by-step sample preparation and assay protocol Seed 1 × 105 BxPC-3 cells in 12-well plates in 1 mL RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% v/v FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 μg/mL each of streptomycin and penicillin."
Prepare two wells for each condition that you want to analyze.
"Prepare an additional well per condition for conventional analysis of loss of membrane integrity (step 20).Let the cells grow for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% v/v CO2.Remove the old medium.For induction of necroptosis, pre-incubate the cells for 30 min at 37°C in 1 mL of fresh medium that contains 20 μM zVAD-fmk and 0.5 μM homoharringtonine (a patient-approved drug that sensitizes cancer cells for necroptosis [352])."
Cycloheximide can be used instead.
Optimal concentrations must be determined for each cell system.
"For induction of apoptosis, omit zVAD-fmk.Add 100 ng/mL KillerTRAIL™ and incubate the cells for 16 h at 37°C.Transfer the medium together with any detached cells into Falcon® 5 mL polystyrene round bottom test tubes that are placed on ice."
"Pool the two wells that you have set up for the same condition in step 1.Wash the wells with 300 μL PBS, pool into the same 5 mL tube.Add 300 μL StemPro™ Accutase™ Cell Dissociation Reagent to each well, incubate for 10–15 min at 37°C to detach all remaining cells and pool everything into the same 5 mL tube.Repeat step 7.Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4°C (5 min, 400 x g), wash twice with cold PBS.Resuspend the cells in 500 μL cold PBS/5 mM EDTA.Fix the cells by dropwise addition of 500 μL 100% v/v ethanol while vortexing.Incubate at room temperature for 30 min (or >24 h at −20°C to get the best resolution if required).Collect the cells by centrifugation at 4°C (5 min, 560 x g)."

"Data analysis The data can be acquired using the acquisition software provided with the flow cytometer, e.g., the BD CellQuest™ Pro software."
"Analysis can be done with either the software used for data acquisition or with any suitable FCM data analysis software.Data acquisition for cell cycle analysis is described in detail in Chapter Chapter V: “Biological Applications,” Section 6.1: “DNA synthesis and cell cycle analysis.” Briefly, PI as DNA-binding dye is excited at 488 nm (blue laser) and emits at a maximum wavelength of 617 nm."
"Thus, PI fluorescence can either be detected using a BP filter 585/42 (FL2 channel of the FACSCalibur flow cytometer) or using a 670 nm LP filter (FL3 channel of the FACSCalibur flow cytometer) or a 695/40 BP filter."
Instrument settings have to be set for the PI fluorescence channel on linear fluorescence scale and the threshold should be set on the same channel with a low value such as 20.
"For sample acquisition and analysis, three sequential plots are needed: dot plot 1: FSC-H versus SSC-H to gate for relevant cell population(s) (gate A); dot plot 2: Pulse Width versus Pulse Area of the PI fluorescence channel set on gate A to exclude doublets and to gate singlets as gate B; histogram 1: Pulse Area of the PI fluorescence channel gated on gate B."
"In total, 10 000–20 000 events in gate B should be collected."
A typical result is shown in Fig.
41A.
"Dot plots 1 are depicted at the left, dot plots 2 in the middle, the respective histograms are shown at the right."
"In the histograms, a marker is placed on sub-G1 cells displaying lower staining intensity than the cell cycle profile, indicating apoptotic cells with fragmented and therefore lost DNA."
"In the dot plots, you can see a shift of the cell population to smaller and less granular cells as typical sign for cell death in both apoptotic as well as necroptotic cells.Using DNA-binding dyes for quantification of dead cells is described in Chapter III: “Before you start: reagent and sample preparation, experimental design,” Section 4.2: “DNA-binding dyes.” For data acquisition using PI as the DNA-binding dye, instrument settings have to be set for the used PI fluorescence channel on logarithmic scale and the threshold should be set on FSC to exclude debris and small cell fragments."
"For sample acquisition and analysis, two sequential plots are needed; dot plot 1: FSC-H versus SSC-H to gate for relevant cell population(s) (gate A), thereby excluding debris and small cellular fragments; dot plot 2: FSC-H versus the respective PI channel set on gate A."
"In total, 10 000–20 000 events in gate A should be collected."
A typical result is shown in Fig.
41B using the same cells and stimulations as used for Fig.

The percentages of PI-negative and PI-positive cells are indicated in the respective dot plot 2.
A similar increase in the amount of PI-positive cells is detected in apoptotic as well as necroptotic samples.
"In summary, the two cell death modes, apoptosis and necroptosis, can be distinguished by cell cycle analysis, while quantification of cell death can be achieved by the simple method of PI staining.7.3.6."
"Pitfalls/Top tricks Please see Chapter V: “Biological Applications,” Section 7.4: “Pyroptosis.”7.4."
Pyroptosis 7.4.1.
"Overview Cell death by pyroptosis critically depends on cleavage of gasdermin proteins by inflammatory caspases, followed by oligomerization and membrane translocation of the gasdermin N-terminal fragment."
"At present, FCM cannot directly track these events and the only definitive proof of pyroptosis is, e.g., by Western blot to detect cleavage of the protein gasdermin D (GSDMD)."
"Yet, pyroptotic cells can be detected indirectly by FCM once pyroptosis has been confirmed."
"In this section, we present the currently available options to assess pyroptosis by FCM."
"In addition, we provide an example protocol to detect activation of inflammatory caspases as an indirect indicator for pyroptosis, noting that this method still requires that pyroptosis be validated by alternative methods but its inclusion in these guidelines is to indicate the potential application of FCM to a variety of cell death mechanisms.7.4.2."
"Introduction The Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death defines pyroptosis “as a form of regulated cell death that critically depends on the formation of plasma membrane pores by members of the gasdermin protein family, often (but not always) as a consequence of inflammatory caspase activation” [329]."
Pyroptosis is a variant of regulated cell death that combines features of both apoptosis and necroptosis.
"Similar to apoptosis, pyroptotic cell death depends on caspase activation."
"On the other hand, rupture of the cell membrane and the release of DAMPs are features shared with necroptosis, classifying pyroptosis as an intensely inflammatory from of regulated cell death [353]."
Pyroptosis occurs in response to microbial infection and has a critical role in immunity against intracellular pathogens [354].
"Pyroptosis disrupts infected cells and thereby causes the release of intracellular pathogens, making them accessible to killing and phagocytosis by neutrophils."
"The concurrent release of DAMPs and of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 recruits additional immune cells, ensuring a robust inflammatory response of both the innate and the adaptive immune system [353, 355]."
"However, pyroptosis can also drive pathogenic inflammation, i.e., in lethal septic shock [353, 356]."
"Pyroptosis is mostly observed in professional phagocytes, but can also occur in other cell types [357]."
"Triggers of pyroptosis encompass bacteria and viruses as well as their products, i.e., LPS and viral DNA [358].The key molecular event in pyroptosis is caspase-mediated cleavage of GSDMD."
"Different from apoptosis, the relevant caspases belong to the inflammatory, not the apoptotic subtype (i.e., caspases-1, −4, and −5 in humans, and caspases-1 and −11 in mice) [354, 357]."
"As an exception, the apoptotic caspase caspase-3 can also induce pyroptosis by cleavage of the GSDMD-related protein gasdermin E [332]."
"GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis can be triggered by two pathways, the canonical or the noncanonical pathway."
"In the canonical pathway, cellular stressors such as bacterial or viral pathogen signatures are recognized by pattern-recognition receptors."
"Together with the adapter protein ASC, these pattern-recognition receptors form complexes (“inflammasomes”), which recruit and activate caspase-1."
"In the noncanonical pathway, human caspases-4 and −5 or mouse caspase-11 are directly activated by cytosolic LPS from Gram-negative bacteria [332, 354]."
"In both pathways, caspase activation results in cleavage of GSDMD and release of its N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N)."
"GSDMD-N then inserts into the plasma membrane of the cell (or into the bacterial plasma membrane) and causes membrane rupture and pyroptotic cell death [332, 354].Given that cleavage of GSDMD as well as membrane translocation and oligomerization of GSDMD-N are the only definitive biomarkers for pyroptosis, the options for direct flow cytometric detection of pyroptosis are as equally limited as for necroptosis (see Chapter V: “Biological Applications,” Section 7.3 “Necroptosis”)."
"At present, the best method to detect cleavage of GSDMD into the 31-kDa GSDMD-N fragment is Western blot using GSDMD-N-specific Abs."
"Membrane translocation of GSDMD-N can be shown via cell fractionation with subsequent Western blot or via immunostaining, and oligomerization of GSDMD-N can be confirmed by nonreducing gel electrophoresis and Western blot.Although direct flow cytometric detection of these biomarkers is not possible at present, the above assays can be performed to initially ensure that pyroptosis is induced by a specific treatment condition."
"Subsequently, FCM can be utilized to routinely detect pyroptotic loss of membrane integrity in identically stimulated cells (PI staining, see also Chapter III: “Before you start: reagent and sample preparation, experimental design,” Section 4.2: “DNA-binding dyes.” and Chapter V: “Biological Applications,” Section 7.3 “Necroptosis”)."
"As a further limitation, parallel control measurements of samples additionally treated with pyroptosis inhibitors are not possible because inhibitors that directly and specifically target GSDMD-N are currently not commercially available."
"As a workaround, cells can be treated with VX-765, an inhibitor of caspase-1, or with MCC950, an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, although inhibition of caspase-1 or the inflammasome may elicit cellular responses beyond inhibition of pyroptosis.Alternatively, it is possible to employ FCM to detect inflammasome formation as an indirect indicator for canonical pyroptosis induction."
"Normally, the inflammasome component ASC is diffusely distributed within the cell, but relocates to a dense speck in the cytosol within minutes of inflammasome activation."
"Sester and colleagues have employed FCM to monitor ASC redistribution in primary macrophages and monocytes, detecting changes in fluorescence peak height and width of immunostained or fluorescently tagged ASC as detailed in ref."
[359].A separate approach to assess pyroptosis by FCM exploits the fact that pyroptosis depends on the activation of inflammatory caspases.
"Upon addition of a green, cell permeant FLICA™ reagent such as fluorescein-6-carbonyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (FAM-YVAD-fmk), activated caspases-1, −4, and −5 covalently and irreversible bind to FAM-YVAD-fmk and become accessible to quantification by FCM as an indirect measure for the initiation of pyroptosis."
"Below, we outline a protocol to quantify the activation of caspases-1, −4, and −5 in nigericin-treated pyroptotic human BxPC3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (a cell line for which pyroptosis has been demonstrated [360]) by conventional FCM (Fig."
"42A), or to simultaneously confirm loss of membrane integrity by PI staining (Fig."
42B).
"Although representing a specific example, the protocol can easily be modified for any treatment that triggers pyroptosis in a particular cell line."
It should be re-stated that this method needs to be used in conjunction with alternative validation of pyroptosis.Open in a separate windowFigure 42.
(A) Single-parameter analysis of BxPC-3 cells left untreated or treated with nigericin for 48 h and analyzed for caspase-1 activity by FAM-FLICA staining (48 h were determined in previous experiments as optimal to achieve the best separation between the FAM-FLICA-positive and the FAM-FLICA-negative population).
"FSC-H versus SSC-H dot plot is depicted on top, the respective histogram is presented at the bottom."
The percentages of FAM-FLICA-positive cells in untreated and nigericin-stimulated cells are indicated in the upper right corner of the histogram.
(B) Dual parameter analysis of BxPC-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells either untreated for 48 h or stimulated with nigericin for 48 h to induce pyroptosis (cells are from the same experiment as shown in (A) but from a parallel stimulation).
For each sample (untreated and treated cells) FSC-H versus SSC-H dot plots are shown on the left and PI versus FAM-FLICA on the right.
The compensation gating is not shown.
This flow cytometric analysis also needs pyroptosis to be validated by methods such as Western blot.7.4.3.
"Step-by-step sample preparation and assay protocol Seed 1 x 105 BxPC3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in 12- well plates in 1 mL RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% v/v FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 μg/mL each of streptomycin and penicillin."
"Prepare three wells for each condition that you want to analyze.Let the cells grow for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% v/v CO2.Reconstitute the lyophilized nigericin contained in the Pyroptosis/Caspase-1 Assay Kit with 100 μL DMSO, yielding a 5 mM stock solution."
"The stock solution can be stored at −20°C for 1 year, provided that it is protected from light and thawed maximally two times.Dilute the nigericin stock solution with sterile ultrapure water to a working concentration of 500 μM immediately before use.Remove the old medium from the cells.To initiate pyroptosis, preincubate the cells for 1 h at 37°C in 300 μL of fresh medium that contains 20 μM nigericin (optimal concentrations must be determined for each cell system).Reconstitute a vial with lyophilized FLICA™ contained in the Pyroptosis/Caspase-1 Assay Kit with 50 μL DMSO, yielding a 150–300× stock solution."
"The stock solution can be stored at −20°C for 6 months, provided that it is protected from light and thawed maximally two times.Dilute the FLICA™ stock solution 1:5 with sterile PBS to a 30–60× working solution and immediately add the working solution to the cells in two wells of each condition at a final concentration of 1–2×.Incubate the cells for 48 h at 37°C, protected from light.Dilute 10× Cellular Wash Buffer contained in the Pyroptosis/Caspase-1 Assay Kit to 1× with ultrapure water.Transfer the medium together with any detached cells into Falcon® 5 mL polystyrene round bottom test tubes that are placed on ice.Add 300 μL 1x Cellular Wash Buffer to each well, incubate for 10 min at 37°C (this allows any unbound FLICA™ to diffuse out of the cells)."
"Remove the Wash Buffer and transfer into the 5 mL tube from step 11.Repeat step 12 twice.Add 300 μL StemPro™ Accutase™ Cell Dissociation Reagent to each well, incubate for 10–15 min at 37°C to detach all remaining cells and transfer everything into new Falcon® 5 mL polystyrene round bottom test tubes.Wash the wells with 300 μL 1× Cellular Wash Buffer, transfer everything into the 5 mL tubes from step 14.Centrifuge the 5 mL tubes from step 13 and from step 15 at 4°C (5 min, 400 × g) to collect all cells.Discard the supernatants and wash the cells twice with cold 1× Cellular Wash Buffer."
"Be careful to avoid cell loss.Resuspend and combine the cells from the two corresponding tubes from steps 13 and 15 in a total of 300 μL cold 1× Cellular Wash Buffer and place on ice.For single-color analysis or for a single-color compensation control (caspase-1 activity), measure the cells (from the first well treated with FLICA™) by FCM within 4 h or fix for analysis within 16 h by adding Fixative contained in the Pyroptosis/Caspase-1 Assay Kit at a v/v ratio of 1:5."
Store your samples protected from light and at 4°C.
"For dual-color analyses (caspase-1 activity and loss of membrane integrity), add 2 μg/mL PI to the cells from the second well treated with FLICA™ and analyze immediately as such assays cannot be performed using fixed cells."
"For a single-color compensation control (loss of membrane integrity), use the cells from the third well (not treated with FLICA™), add 2 μg/mL PI and analyze immediately.Measure your cells in a suitable flow cytometer, such as the BD FACSCalibur™.7.4.4."

Analysis can be done with either the software used for data acquisition or with any suitable FCM data analysis software.
"For data analysis, follow the manual provided with the Pyroptosis/Caspase-1 Assay Kit."
The FAM-FLICA reagent is excited at 488 nm (blue laser) and has a peak emission at 515–535 nm.
"Thus, FAM-FLICA fluorescence can be detected using a BP filter 530/30 (FL1 channel of the FACSCalibur flow cytometer)."
"For single-staining, instrument settings have to be set for the FAM-FLICA fluorescence channel on logarithmic fluorescence scale and the threshold should be set on FSC to exclude small cellular fragments and debris."
"For sample acquisition and analysis, two sequential plots are needed: an FSC-H versus SSC-H dot plot to gate on the population of interest (gate A) and a histogram plot with the log FAM-FLICA fluorescence on the x-axis versus the number of cells on the y-axis set on gate A."
"Adjust the voltage of the FAM-FLICA fluorescence channel, if necessary, to ensure that fluorescence is on scale and caspase-negative (FAM-FLICA−) cells appear within the lower log fluorescence output decades of the x-axis."
Caspase-positive (FAM-FLICA+) cells will appear as a shoulder or as a separate peak shifted to the right side of the negative peak.
A typical result demonstrating a histogram overlay of negative and positive cells is shown in Fig.
42A.
"The gate is set on FAM-FLICA-positive cells and their percentages in untreated and nigericin-stimulated cells are indicated in the upper right corner of the histogram.For dual-color analyses using additionally PI as DNA-binding dye, first run each single-color untreated control."
PI is excited at 488 nm (blue laser) and emits at a maximum wavelength of 617 nm.
"Thus, PI fluorescence can either be detected using a BP filter 585/42 (FL2 channel of the FACSCalibur flow cytometer) or using a 670 nm LP filter (FL3 channel of the FACSCalibur flow cytometer) or a 695/40 BP filter."
"To determine the correct instrument settings, use the single-color untreated cells and analyze two dot plots, FAM-FLICA-fluorescence versus FSC-H and PI fluorescence versus FSC-H (use a logarithmic fluorescence scale for both channels) set on gate A."
Adjust the voltages for both fluorescence channels so that PI- or FAM-FLICA-negative cells appear in the lower log fluorescence output decades.
"For compensation, use the single-color nigericin-treated cells as compensation controls (see Chapter II: “Setup: Instrument setup and quality control,” Section 1: “Compensation”).For sample acquisition and analysis, the following gating steps are required."
"First, FSC-H versus SSC-H to gate for the relevant cell population(s) (gate A)."
"Second, FAM-FLICA-fluorescence versus PI fluorescence set on gate A is used to quantify double-negative cells (healthy), single-FAM-FLICA-positive cells (containing activated caspase-1 without signs of pyroptosis), single-PI-positive cells (undergoing cell death independently of caspase-1) and double-positive cells (undergoing pyroptosis)."
"In total, 10 000–20 000 events in gate A should be collected."
A typical result is shown in Fig.
42B.7.4.6.
"Pitfalls/Top tricks When studying necroptosis, to obtain credible results, it is imperative that your cells are mycoplasma-negative because mycoplasma express large amounts of nucleases [361], and you will detect false-positive DNA fragmentation in necroptotic cells if cells are contaminated."
"Also, using NIH3T3 cells may be problematic as various sublines exist that differ in their disposition to undergo necroptosis with or without caspase inhibition [362], thus possibly leading to mixed cell death mechanisms."
"However, in our proposed protocol, cell cycle staining showing fragmented DNA as sub-G1 cells would clearly reveal such a mixed cell death mechanism by demonstrating more PI-positive cells (general cell death) than sub-G1 cells (purely apoptosis).When studying pyroptosis, protect samples containing FAM-YVAD-FMK from light."
"Also, the optimal time-point to achieve the best separation between the FAM-FLICA-positive and the FAM-FLICA negative population has to be determined individually for each cell line."
"In dual-color analyses for pyroptosis, more PI-positive cells may be detected than in single-color PI analyses due to the more extensive washing and handling of the cells."
"As an additional point to take note of, binding of FLICA reagents to their target sequence is generally not as caspase-specific as originally thought because of the FMK group reactivity with thiol groups of intracellular proteins that become available upon caspase cleavage [363]."
"Nevertheless, and despite this apparent lack of absolute specificity, FLICA probes have consistently shown themselves to be highly reliable reporters of caspase activation [364] and the assay presented here has been successfully used to detect caspase-1 activation in recent studies [365, 366].It is recommended to consult Chapter III: “Before you start: reagent and sample preparation, experimental design,” Section 4.2: “DNA-binding dyes,” Chapter V: “Biological Applications,” Sections 6.1: “DNA synthesis and cell cycle analysis,” Section 7.1: “Apoptosis: Measurement of apoptosis,” and Section 7.2: “Apoptosis: Caspase activation” as well as the manual of the Pyroptosis/Caspase-1 Assay Kit for additional information regarding cell death measurement.As a general pitfall, it has to be pointed out that the protocols described to analyze either necroptosis or pyroptosis by FCM are not specific for the mode of cell death."
The lack of DNA fragmentation as detected by cell cycle analysis merely excludes apoptosis but does not discriminate between different modes of cell death leading to membrane rupture without caspase activation.
"Therefore, the occurrence of necroptosis or pyroptosis has to be validated by alternative methods, i.e., when analyzing a new cell system, you will have to make sure that your treatment indeed induces the cell death mode under investigation, either necroptosis, e.g., by Western blot for phosphorylation of RIPK3 and/or MLKL [352, 367], or pyroptosis by Western blot to detect cleavage of GSDMD."
"Western blot analysis, however, is at best semiquantitative, because all cells are analyzed as a single population."
"In contrast, FCM yields a quantitative result as it analyses each cell within the sample separately and therefore provides additional information.A reasonable way to enhance the specificity of the flow cytometric assays described here would be the use of inhibitors while stimulating the cells that are specific for necroptosis (necrostatin-1s, GSK'840, GSK'843, GSK'872, or necrosulfonamide) or pyroptosis (VX-765 and MCC950), although the pyroptosis inhibitors may affect other cell processes and complicate the interpretation.8."
Phagocytosis8.1.
Overview Phagocytes are essential components of the first defensive line of the innate immune system.
"Professional phagocytes include neutrophilic and eosinopilic granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, tissue-resident macrophages (e.g, alveolar macrophages, marginal zone and metallophilic splenic macrophages, Kupffer cells of the liver, intestinal macrophages, osteoclasts, and microglia of the brain) and macrophages derived from monocytes during inflammatory processes [368]."
"Phagocytosis is, indeed, one of the most ancient and evolutionarily conserved functions of immunity [369].Ingesting and killing of microorganisms involves intrinsic functions of phagocytes as well as complex interactions between phagocytes, pathogens, and plasma factors such as opsonins."
Deficiencies in these functions or interactions are associated with increased susceptibility to infection.
"Phagocytosis as part of the antimicrobial immune defense involves sequentially chemotactic migration of the phagocytes, recognition of pathogen determinants, ingestion of microorganisms, and finally, destruction by oxygen-dependent (e.g., “oxidative burst” of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase [Phox], NO production by the type 2 or inducible nitric oxide synthase [NOS2, iNOS]) and oxygen-independent mechanisms (e.g., acidification and protease activities, antimicrobial peptides) [368].It is important to note that the interaction with extracellular or intracellular pathogens may lead to the apoptotic death of phagocytes [370]."
"On the other hand, phagocyte recognition of apoptotic cells helps clearance of senescent, stressed, damaged, or altered cells of the body from tissues."
Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells prevents the release of cell components that might otherwise trigger inflammatory response [371].
Phagoptosis is a form of cell death caused by primary phagocytosis and destruction of viable cells.
"Phagoptosis mediates turnover of erythrocytes, neutrophils and other cells, and thus is one of the main forms of cell death in the body."
"Phagoptosis is triggered by exposure of “eat-me” signals (such as phosphatidylserine or calreticulin) and/or loss of “donť-eat-me” signals (such as CD47) on the plasma membrane of viable cells, causing their phagocytosis by phagocytes."
"Live cells may modify the expression of such signals as a result of cell stress, damage, activation, or senescence [372].Also of interest is the study of phagocytic ingestion of synthetic nanoparticles in the range of 1–100 nm."
These particles are increasingly used in industrial and commercial products [373].8.2.
Flow cytometric assays of phagocytosis: Fundamentals and general applications FCM has been used for many years to study phagocytosis [374–380].
"Although frequent applications include the clinical study of human immunodeficiencies and septic conditions [381], phagocytosis assays also serve veterinary [382] and environmental settings [383] as well as a growing multiplicity of other experimental settings.In classical FCM phagocytosis assays, phagocytes are incubated at 37°C with fluorescent target particles pre-opsonized with an appropriate dilution of serum."
"Phagocytosis is measured as the mean fluorescence of effector cells and/or the percentages of fluorochrome-positive phagocytes, or serum dilutions at which a defined endpoint value is calculated."
"These techniques have intrinsic drawbacks, such as quenching of fluorescence upon internalization, the difficulty to distinguish between adherent and internalized bacteria in most cases, or a failure to determine Ab-mediated phagocytosis [374–380].Phagocytosis studies benefit from the unique integration of functional and phenotypic information provided by FCM and the large availability of phagocytic cell types and targets (both natural and synthetic) that are suitable for the technical capabilities of FCM [374–380]."
"In many cases, FCM assays of phagocytosis are available as commercial kits, and may include simultaneous assessment of other functional aspects or consequences of phagocytosis, typically the oxidative burst [381] or apoptosis [381, 384].8.3."
Critical points in the pre-analytical and analytical phases of assays 8.3.1.
"Phagocytic cell types and sample preparation FCM assays of phagocytosis and other phagocytic-related functions can be performed on a large variety of primary phagocytic cells, including but not restricted to peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils from humans (Fig."
"43) [381], rats [385], dogs [386], cats [387], cows [388], or cetaceans (Fig."
"44) [383], human dendritic cells [389], human peritoneal [390] or monocyte-derived macrophages [391], peritoneal- or bone-marrow murine macrophages [392], and coelomocytes from earthworms [393]."
"In addition, several established cell lines with phagocytic capacity can be used for experimental studies, typically the human monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1, or the murine macrophage cell lines J774A.1 and RAW 264.7 [394].Open in a separate windowFigure 43.Representative examples of strategies to differentiate between attached and internalized fluorescent bacteria in whole-blood phagocytosis assays by conventional flow cytometry (A–C) and imaging flow cytometry (D–F)."
"In both assays, whole-blood samples anticoagulated with heparin were stained with CD45-APC (A) or CD45-PE (D) Ab and incubated for 30 min at 37°C (B) or at 4°C (C) with a suspension of Escherichia coli (ATCC 11775) transformed by electroporation with a plasmid containing the GFP gene (pMEK91 GFP)."
The ratio of bacteria to leukocytes was 1:4.
"Then, samples were lysed with BD FACS Lysing Solution, put on ice and analyzed immediately in a BD Accuri C6 conventional flow cytometer (A–C) or in an Amnis ImageStream 100 multispectral imaging flow cytometer (D–F), both using a 488 nm blue laser."

Comparison of B and C shows the difference between granulocytes with adherent and/or internalized bacteria (74.5% of the population after incubation at 37°C) and granulocytes with only adherent bacteria (3.8% of the population after incubation at 4°C).

Data were obtained in a CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).

Graph (F): Fluorescence intensity of pHrodo Red E. coli BioParticles in the assay tube, showing the high level of E. coli BioParticles ingestion by phagocytic cells from the blood of a healthy dolphin.When using whole blood samples, heparin is often the anticoagulant of choice, as both EDTA and citrate bind divalent cations and thereby can interfere with phagocytosis processes and oxidative burst (e.g., see ref."
[395–397]).
All classical anticoagulants negatively affect complement activity and opsonophagocytosis [398].
Anticoagulated blood samples should be processed within 4 h of collection.
Prolonged storage may lead to abnormal results.
"Specimens should typically be maintained at 18–22°C, and temperatures below 10°C and above 30°C must be avoided if possible when using whole blood."
"If cryo-preserved blood cells are used for assay, it is essential to thaw and use the cells rapidly."
Neutrophils are particularly fragile.
"Myeloid cells can be activated by endotoxins, excessive agitation, or repeated centrifugations, resulting in cell death."
Endotoxin-free polypropylene tubes should be used.
"Cell clumping after standing at room temperature can be avoided by using the cells promptly or by adding DNase to the cell suspension [377].Human PBMCs and neutrophils can be isolated by using different classical procedures, with dextran sedimentation preferable for neutrophil purification and gradient centrifugation by Histopaque 1077 for monocyte enrichment [399]."
"In addition, magnetic separation can be used successfully to isolate functional primary phagocytic cells based upon immunophenotypic myeloid cell determinants [91]."
Human monocytes are often cultured in serum-free or serum-supplemented media to create macrophages or dendritic cells [91].8.3.2.
"Phagocytosis targets A multiplicity of fluorescent biological and synthetic micro- or nanoparticles can be used as suitable targets for phagocytosis with FCM assays, reflecting, on the one hand, the different roles and clinical failures of phagocytosis, and on the other hand, the diversity of plasma membrane receptors that mediate phagocytic recognition of microbes, apoptotic cells, or synthetic particles [368].The best biological targets are live microorganisms, including pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria and yeast."
"Because of their hazardous nature, pathogens can be inactivated by different means."
"However, inactivation by heat killing (e.g., boiling) may result in loss of cell wall components, which are extremely important for phagocyte recognition, thus potentially reducing phagocytosis [400]."
Inactivation by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde may preserve some pathogen-associated determinants and improves recognition [401].
"Another typical target for phagocytosis assays are zymosan particles, prepared from the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and consisting of protein-carbohydrate complexes [376–378, 402]."
"FCM assays of phagocytosis can use fluorescent microbeads of different optical properties, chemical composition, and diameter that may be, in addition, coupled with components relevant for receptor-mediated particle recognition [377].Since physiological phagocytosis occurs mainly after binding of opsonized particles to receptors of the constant fragment of immunoglobulins (Fc) or complement receptors expressed on phagocytes, it may be essential to ensure opsonization of phagocytosis targets."
"Engagement of phagocyte Fc receptors is achieved by pre-incubation of targets with appropriate sera or IgG solutions, as well as by coating of fluorescent beads with IgG Abs."
"In this aspect, whole-blood assays of phagocytosis have the advantage of not requiring additional steps of target opsonization.As rates of phagocytosis are highly dependent on the target-to-cell ratio, accurate counting of targets and effector phagocytes and the use of a suitable ratio is important [402]."
Target: effector ratios ranging from 1:1 [402] to 260:1 [403] have been applied in different assay settings.
"Similarly, the determination of the duration of the assay must take into account the difference of phagocytosis kinetics between synthetic and natural targets, as well as among different types of biological targets."
"One-hour incubation is usually sufficient and typically, phagocytosis assays require incubation times of 15–30 min [404].8.3.3."
Fluorescent labeling of targets There are several convenient commercial sources of fluorescently conjugated biological and synthetic particles [379].
"In some cases, such particles are components of assay kits that can be used in conventional FCM using a suitable laser."
"For custom labeling of targets, the most common fluorescent labels are incorporated as N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, which react covalently with –NH2 groups [379]."
"Fluorescein derivatives (e.g., fluorescein, dicarboxyfluorescein, Oregon Green, dihydrodichlorofluorescein) have been popular, but their fluorescence is quenched in the acidic compartments of phagocytes and, moreover, their emission wavelength overlaps markedly with green autofluorescence, which is especially present in macrophages and monocytes [405]."
"Other fluorophores such as Alexa Fluor, BODIPY FL, tetramethylrhodamine, and Texas Red have stable, intense emission over a broad pH range (pH 4–9)."
"Most interestingly, pHrodo, a new series of probes with green or red fluorescence emission increasing with decreasing pH has been recently developed [379, 406]."
Fluorescent protein-expressing E. coli strains are also suitable for FCM assays [407–409].8.3.4.
"Identification of live subpopulations of phagocytic cells by light scatter and surface immunophenotype The nucleated phagocytes in whole blood assays may be distinguished from debris and from smaller targets (microorganisms and fluorescent beads) by gating on the granulocyte and monocyte populations using FSC and SSC properties [377, 379]."
"As phagocytosis may lead to degranulation and even apoptosis of phagocytes, especially neutrophils, it is recommended to include at least a viability marker and eventually appropriate immunophenotypic markers (for human cells, e.g., CD45, CD14, CD13, CD15, CD16, CD11b) [410]."
It is worth mentioning that the lymphocyte population in whole blood assays may often serve as an internal negative control of nonphagocytic cells.
"In FCM assays using homogeneous phagocytic populations (e.g., U937, TPH-1, RAW264.7 cell lines) and small targets, it is recommended to include viability markers, in order to exclude nonspecific attachment of targets to dead or dying phagocytic cells."
"In those specialized assays, in which target cells (e.g., apoptotic cells, infected erythrocytes) may have similar size as phagocyte effectors, it is recommended to separately label effectors and/or targets with appropriate tracking dyes [403, 411].In all cases, phagocytosis assays involving immunophenotyping with multicolor cytometry should include the appropriate controls for fluorescence compensation (single-stained tubes) and gating (FMO controls)."
"This is further discussed in Chapter II, Section 1, Compensation.8.3.5."
"Distinguishing non-internalized from internalized particles In order to accurately assess the phagocytosis process, it is mandatory to demonstrate that the particles are in fact ingested as opposed to coincident with the phagocyte in the laser-illuminated volume or adherent to the cell surface.While coincidence of phagocytes and targets can be minimized by running diluted samples at slower flow rates, quantification of internalized particles as opposed to surface adherent particles may be approached by different strategies:Comparing the cell-associated fluorescence intensity in conditions avoiding (negative controls) or allowing particle internalization."
Negative controls of this type should include cells incubated without fluorescent targets (which allows for the detection of autofluorescence) and cells and targets co-incubated at 4°C (Fig.
"43) or in the presence of inhibitors of cytoskeleton rearrangement, such as the most commonly used cytochalasins (Fig."
"44), or other inhibitors of phagocyte function, such as N-ethylmaleimide [404].Using targets labeled with a dye that is sensitive to quenching agents."
"FITC or Calcofluor White can be quenched by trypan blue and crystal violet [377–379], while Sytox Green is quenched by PI [400]."
"In this approach, extra washing steps are necessary to remove the quenching dye, thus increasing assay time and making the assay prone to artifacts and cell loss.Using fluorescent targets emitting fluorescence at different wavelengths at neutral or acidic pH."
"Probes of this type include the pHRodo series, and the Eos-FP fluorescent protein."
"pHRodo dye can be used for the labeling of targets, as it reacts with the primary amino groups on the particle to yield a covalently linked pH probe, which increases fluorescence emission as the pH of its environment becomes more acidic."
"Due to the low pH of the phagolysosome, phagocytized targets can be quantified without interference of adherent particles [379, 406, 412, 413]."
"The optimal absorption and fluorescence emission maxima of the pHrodo Green dye and its conjugates are approximately 509 nm and 533 nm, respectively, while pHrodo Red excites at 560 nm and emits at 585 nm."
Both pHrodo Green and pHrodo Red can also be excited with the 488 nm argon-ion laser installed on most flow cytometers (Fig.
44).Eos-FP can be transfected into infectious microorganisms.
"After UV-irradiation of bacteria, peptide cleavage in Eos-FP occurs and the transfected bacteria emit green (≈516 nm) and orange (≈581 nm) fluorescent light at 488 nm excitation."
"Orange fluorescence is sensitive to acidic pH, and the phagocytosed bacteria stop emitting orange fluorescent light as soon as the phagosomes fuse with lysosomes."
The green fluorescence is maintained in the phagolysosome until bacterial degradation is completed [408].Applying imaging FCM.
"This novel technique of cytometry combines the statistical power and fluorescence sensitivity of standard FCM with the spatial resolution and quantitative morphology of digital microscopy, as it is based on the capture of images of particles in flow and subsequent pixel-based image analysis of objects [413]."
"Imaging FCM allows defining the intracellular localization of fluorescent targets in phagocytes, thus ruling out the need of quenching or blocking steps (Fig."
43) [414–416].8.3.6.
"Assessing or quantifying phagocytosis kinetics and capacity The simplest calculation is the proportion of phagocytosing cells within the evaluated population, defined as the percentage of gated cells with target fluorescence, present in the appropriate gate(s), established by morphological, viability, and immunophenotypic criteria [377], as seen in Fig."
"44.Regarding the quantification of ingested fluorescent targets, calculation may be relatively straightforward if pH-independent fluorescent particles (biological or synthetic) are used."
"The mean number of particles ingested per effector cell can be calculated by dividing the MFI of the cell population by the fluorescence of a single, extracellular target [417]."
"When using targets labeled with pH-dependent dyes, however, this calculation is inaccurate and must be modified by subtracting the number of free targets per phagocyte from the initial number of targets per phagocyte [377, 378].An interesting parameter to quantify phagocytosis capacity is the phagocytosis product (PP) parameter [377]."
PP is defined as the percentage of phagocytosing cells multiplied by the number of targets per phagocytosing cell.
PP reflects that the total elimination of targets from a given assay preparation depends both of the percentage of phagocytosing cells and the number of targets ingested by each effector cell [377].8.4.
A general protocol for assesing phagocytosis in whole-blood samples using pHrodo Red E.coli BioParticles 8.4.1.
"Overview This assay is suitable to determine phagocytic activity in whole blood samples based on the use of pHrodo E. coli Red BioParticles, which undergo a strong increase in fluorescence when the surrounding pH becomes more acidic during the ingestion phase of phagocytosis process."
"Labeling of whole blood samples with appropriate pan-leukocytic markers, such as CD45 or CD11a (Fig."
"44), easily allows excluding easily erythrocytes and platelets."
Using species-specific phagocyte markers allows to evaluate phagocytosis of pHrodo BioParticles by granulocytes in multiple species [418].
"By adding a suitable fluorogenic substrate of ROS such as Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123), this protocol allows the simultaneous examination of phagocytosis and oxidative burst.CD11a clone HI111 reacts with human, rhesus, cynomolgus, or baboon monkey, dog, and rabbit."
"Moreover, it has been shown in our laboratory to crossreact with some cetaceans and pinnipedes."
"Thus, in addition to human studies, this protocol has been successfully applied to evaluate ingestion of E. coli and respiratory burst in whole-blood samples of dolphins (Fig."
"44), Beluga whales, and walruses.8.4.2."

Autophagy9.1.
Overview Autophagy is a cellular catabolic pathway tightly regulated for homeostasis maintenance and remodeling.
"During autophagy, cellular debris and other cargo is delivered by autophagosomes to lysosomes for degradation and recycling."
"LC3-II, which localizes to autophagosomes, is a widely used autophagy marker."
"In this section, quantitative measurement of autophagy focusing on FCM staining of LC3-II will be discussed.9.2."
Introduction Autophagy is a lysosome-based catabolic pathway for the degradation and turnover of cytoplasmic constituents.
"Stressors, such as nutrient starvation and hypoxia, are potent autophagy inducers."
"To maintain cellular homeostasis, cellular debris is removed by constitutive (basal) autophagy."
"Autophagy generates metabolites, which are reused as sources of energy or synthesis of new macromolecules."
"It is known to be an important player in the regulation of proliferation, cell growth, remodeling, and differentiation in a number of systems [419]."
"There are three main types of autophagy in mammalian cells: chaperone-mediated autophagy [420], microautophagy [421], and macroautophagy [419]."
"The techniques described in this section detect macroautophagy that hereafter will be referred to as autophagy.Autophagy is tightly regulated by complex signaling pathways including mTORC1, AMPK, class I PI3K complex, AKT, ULK1 complex, and class III PI3K complex."
"Close to 40 core autophagy genes have been identified that mediate the completion of a double-membrane autophagosome, which engulfs unwanted cytosolic material such as aged and damaged organelles, protein aggregates, or pathogens."
Subsequent fusion of the autophagosome to the lysosome enables degradation of the cargo (Fig.
45).
"Autophagy related genes (ATGs) were originally identified in yeast, but most of these are evolutionarily conserved in higher organisms such as mammals [422]."
A key player often used to quantify autophagy is the ATG8-family member MAP1LC3B (LC3).
"During autophagosome elongation, the cytosolic protein LC3-I is lipidated by conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine to become LC3-II, and thereby inserted into the membrane of the growing autophagosome.Open in a separate windowFigure 45.Autophagy pathway (modified and reproduced with permission from ref."
[423]).
"In the first step of autophagy, a double-membraned vesicle is formed, which elongates to form an autophagosome (left)."
"During the elongation step, the cytosolic protein LC3-I is lipidated to become LC3-II, which is inserted into the membrane of the growing autophagosome."
"The autophagosome closes, engulfing bulk cytoplasmic material to be degraded (middle)."
The autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome to breakdown the autophagy vesicle and its contents (right).
"Autophagy inducers are shown in RED, and autophagic flux inhibitors are shown in BLUE.Autophagic flux (i.e., flow through the autophagy pathway) is used to measure autophagic activity."
One such approach is to measure the rate of protein breakdown by autophagy by arresting the autophagic degradation at a given point and recording the time-dependent accumulation of representative autophagic cargoes.
"The most common way to induce this block is to inhibit lysosomal proteolysis, thus, increasing levels of autophagosomes and the autophagosome marker LC3-II, which can be measured."
"Many compounds are known to block the autophagic flux [424] such as chloroquine, which primarily inhibits autophagosome–lysosome fusion [425], and bafilomycin A1 (BafA), which inhibits both lysosomal acidification (thus inhibits lysosomal hydrolase activity) and autophagosome–lysosome fusion [426]."
Both are common inhibitors used to measure autophagic flux (Fig.
45).9.3.
"Flow cytometry autophagy assays In recent years, autophagy has been successfully measured with commonly used techniques such as Western blot and microscopy [427]."
"However, these assays have their limitations since a certain number of cells are needed or cell sorting is required to measure autophagy in a specific cell type within a mixed cell population."
"More recently, novel techniques for FCM and imaging FCM have opened up new possibilities in the field of autophagy."
"Not only can primary cells be analyzed, these techniques also allow a higher throughput and the possibility to measure multiple parameters simultaneously."
"As the available Abs to LC3 do not discriminate between its lipidated and non-lipidated forms, these techniques rely on detecting punctate LC3 visible by imaging or removing the non-lipidated form prior to staining [428].Detection of fused autophagosomes also relies on the identification of lysosomes, as required for the Amnis® ImageStream autophagy assay described later."
Lysosomes are acidic organelles that can be identified by pH sensors.
"One example of such reagents are the LysoTracker probes (ThermoFisher Scientific), which are selective for acidic organelles."
"They must be used at low concentrations (usually 50 nM) and incubation time should be restricted to 1–5 min before imaging, otherwise they induce an increase in lysosomal pH."
"They can, however, be fixed with aldehydes, but the autofluorescence or non-specific staining as mentioned by the manufacturer, means their specificity for quantifying lysosomes by FCM will depend on the cell type."
"However, Lysotracker has had some success in flow assays with cells showing an increase in signal after treatment with chloroquine [429]."
"LysoSensor pH indicators (ThermoFisher Scientific) are similar, but exhibit a pH-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity upon acidification."
They have the same issue of increasing lysosomal pH with longer incubation times and nonspecific staining when used for FCM.
Lyso-ID (Enzo) is another acidic organelle-selective dye but does not increase lysosomal pH over time lending itself to short- and long-term tracking of lysosomes.
"An alternative are lysosome-specific Abs, such as against the LAMP family members."
Anti-LAMP1 staining was shown to give the same results when compared to Lyso-ID in the autophagy imaging FCM assay discussed later in this guideline [430].Autophagy FCM assays include:Amnis® ImageStream autophagy assay.
Imaging FCM allows quantification of endogenous LC3 puncta while detecting surface markers.
"To detect autolysosomes, the co-localization between LC3 and lysosomes using a bright detail similarity analysis feature can be used [430–432] (See Chapter VIII, Section Imaging FCM for general introduction to ImageStream).Cyto-ID® Autophagy detection kit (Enzo)This is a proprietary dye that stains autophagic vesicles."
Version 2.0 of the kit has been developed in 2015 with better performance in signal intensity and photostability compared to the old version.
"Both versions seem to stain autophagic vesicles in a pH-dependent manner, as blocking lysosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 significantly compromises the staining signal."
"In contrast, chloroquine that blocks autophagosome–lysosome fusion is compatible with the kit as shown by the manufacturer."
The staining is simple and direct (see protocol provided by the manufacturer).
"However, the data is difficult to interpret as the manufacturer does not state the mechanism on which the staining is based.FlowCellect Autophagy LC3 kit (Merck Millipore)."
Selective cell membrane permeabilization with mild detergents allows discrimination between cytosolic non-lipidated LC3-I from membrane bound LC3-II by washing out the soluble cytosolic form.
This is our first choice to measure autophagy in primary cells.
"Selective detection of endogenous LC3-II by FCM provides many advantages to investigate autophagy in primary cells including lower cell numbers, detection of surface markers, and other parameters at the same time and it is significantly quicker than the ImageStream autophagy assay."
This assay was first reported by Eng et al.
"[428], and can also be performed with common laboratory chemicals and anti-LC3 Abs."
Optimization might be required for different conditions and primary cells.9.4.
"Step-by-step sample preparation (FlowCellect Autophagy LC3 kit, adapted from the manufacturer's protocol) Collect tissues and homogenize into single cell suspension.Culture cells at 37°C in appropriate medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS for human or murine hematopoietic cells) containing autophagic flux inhibitors (e.g., 10 nM bafilomycin A1) or vehicle for 2 h.

Data analysis A rough idea of autophagic flux can be directly obtained from LC3-II histograms (Fig.
46A and ​andB).B).
"After compensation and gating on the cell population of interest, the geometric mean of LC3-II fluorescence intensity can be determined."
Autophagy is a complex cellular process and more accurate assessment requires quantification and calculation.
"Therefore, different aspects of the autophagic flux are determined by the following calculations:Open in a separate windowFigure 46.An example of autophagy induction and flux measurement with the FlowCellect LC3 kit in murine B cells."
(A) Unstimulated murine splenocytes were cultured with 10 nM Bafilomycin A1 (BafA) or Vehicle (Basal) for 2 h. LC3-II expression was quantified by FCM.
(B) Purified murine B cells were stimulated with 10 μg/mL LPS for 3 days and treated with BafA as in (A) during the last 2 h before harvest.
LC3-II expression was measured by FCM.
"(C–E) The quantification of basal LC3-II levels (MFI Basal LC3-II) (C), net autophagic flux (MFI (BafA-Basal) LC3-II) (D), and normalized autophagic flux (MFI (BafA-Basal)/Basal LC3-II) (E) are shown."
Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
Studenťs t-test.
"*P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ****P ≤ 0.0001.Basal LC3-II levels alone are a direct measurement of the number of autophagosomes (Fig."
46C).
"Their increase indicates either increased autophagosome formation or blocked lysosomal degradation, or both.BafA minus basal LC3-II calculates the amount of LC3-II being degraded during the period of BafA treatment, which is the net autophagic flux (Fig."
46D).
"(BafA minus basal)/ basal LC3-II is a modified version of autophagic flux measurement, which normalizes the net autophagic flux to basal LC3-II levels, eliminating variation in basal LC3-II (including tissue-specific variation and cell size) and thereby quantifying the efficiency of autophagy (Fig."
46E).The combination of these different ways of quantification will gain a comprehensive analysis of autophagy occurring within the cell.
"To confirm autophagy levels found by LC3-II, we recommend to also measure other autophagy-related processes such as lysosomal function and mass, degradation of autophagy adaptor proteins (e.g., p62), other proteins expressed on autophagosomes (e.g., WIPI2), and signaling molecules (e.g., phosphorylation status of mTOR and ULK1) by FCM, microscopy, and Western blot.9.7."
Pitfalls The autophagy levels in different types of primary cells under different conditions vary a lot.
"Often, only small changes after autophagy inducing or inhibiting treatments are being observed in comparison to cell lines."
"Many commonly used autophagy inducers such as rapamycin, torin 1, or starvation do not cause large differences in autophagy levels in naïve immune cells according to our unpublished data."
"Typically in immune cells, cell-specific stimulations such as through the TCR, BCR, TLR, or cytokine receptors are the strongest and the most reliable (Table 10) [433]."
"Generally, it is wise to test a wide panel of inducers and inhibitors in a time course to find the best read out."
"Notably, when using any compounds to induce autophagy, the vehicle needs to be considered."
"For example, DMSO is known to induce autophagy [434] and therefore should be avoided if possible or used at minimum concentrations for a short period."
"As usual, it is necessary to include vehicle-treated controls in all experiments as any mild stress might induce autophagy.Table 10.Autophagy inducers for human primary immune cells."
"Treatments that successfully induce autophagy after 24 ha)Primary cell typeAutophagy inducerT cellsαCD3/CD28 (highest after 4 days)B cellsIgM, megaCD40LMonocytesLPS, IFN-γMacrophagesLPS, IFN-γOpen in a separate windowa)This is not an exhaustive list and kinetic experiments have not been performed.One also needs to be aware of off-target effects of compounds used to modulate autophagy."
Some may require specific concentrations or incubation times [424].
"For example, 3-MA (inhibiting class III PI3K Vps34 in autophagy pathway) is of low potency, requiring it to be used at ~10 mM to block autophagosome formation."
"At this concentration, it can also affect other kinases including class I PI3K, p38MAPK, or c-Jun kinase, therefore affecting many cellular processes [435]."
"For this reason, 3-MA is not our primary choice to inhibit autophagy."
"Bafilomycin A1 is widely used in many laboratories but in primary cells, we recommend to use at a low concentrations for <4 h, otherwise it is toxic."
"It also needs to be noted that bafilomycin A may inhibit the proteasome, endocytic trafficking, and other cellular processes [436].There are several drawbacks of the FlowCellect Autophagy LC3 kit."
The LC3-II staining is incompatible with other intracellular staining because it requires the wash-out of cytosolic proteins.
"As permeabilization and fixation are required for the assay, live cell sorting cannot be performed."
"Moreover, autophagy induction involves conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and thereby the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I is another way to quantify autophagy induction."
Yet the current protocol of LC3 kit cannot be used to measure LC3-I.
"Generally speaking, every technique has its own advantages and limitations."
"It is important to choose the best one for the experimental question, and ideally combine several techniques.9.8."
"Top tricks Being a stress response, autophagy can be nonspecifically induced by many insults."
Therefore first keeping live cells at low temperatures during sample preparation at all times (except for the cell culture step) helps to minimize these unwanted effects on autophagy.
"Second, for adherent cells, care must be taken when preparing single cell suspensions."
"The detachment requires disruption and injury of the plasma membrane, which can induce autophagy."
"For some cells, we found Accutase® induced less autophagy when compared to scraping or trypsinization.Finally, the LC3 kit assay involves multiple washing steps."
Accumulative cell loss during each centrifugation may eventually lead to a very low yield of cells.
"To maximize the sample recovery, 96-well V-bottom plates are recommended over U-bottom plates.10."
Reactive oxygen species production with minimal sample perturbation10.1.
Overview FCM enables the detection of ROS in live cells.
"However, RBC lysis and sample manipulation can result in incomplete lysis of erythrocytes or in unwanted damage to leukocytes."
"This sample manipulation can cause both cellular depletion and artifactual activation and may result in inaccurate measurements of ROS, especially in those cases where target cells are the minority."
"No-lyse no-wash protocols reduce sample handling, are simple and fast, and perhaps most importantly, they can minimize sample preparation and consequent artifacts relevant to the biology of increasingly important assays that target fragile cell subsets and or combine live cell function with cell phenotype."
"In order to mimic physiological conditions, this method takes advantage of classic methods that are widely used in FCM and is applicable for both murine and to human cord blood, peripheral blood, and bone marrow specimens."
Examples provided in this section are from human PBMCs.10.2.
Introduction ROS have been shown to be associated with oxidative stress [437].
"Toxic, oxygen free radicals contribute to aging [438], apoptosis [439, 440], and pathological processes [441] in many clinical disorders, such as cardiac dysfunction and myocyte injury [442, 443]."
"More recently, ROS have also been shown to be involved in signaling processes [444–450], having a role as signaling molecules that generate specificity in ROS homeostasis.ROS are generated during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or after interaction of myeloid immune cells with xenobiotic compounds [447], and their rate of production increases under hypoxia or after inhibition of mitochondrial respiration [451, 452]."
"The term ROS includes superoxide anion (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl anion (OH−), hypohalous acid anions (e.g."
"OCl−, OBr−), ozone, singlet oxygen, and so on [447]."
ROS are formed by the incomplete reduction of oxygen.
ROS are mainly free radicals that many times are not very reactive and have a short half-life [446].
"Oxygen-derived free radicals are molecular species with unpaired electrons [453] and are the product of multiple biological oxidation and reduction pathways [447].Although ROS are generated during normal mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, they are also generated in cellular response to exogenous compounds, cytokines, and bacterial invasion [450, 454, 455]."
"ROS, including all highly reactive molecules that contain oxygen, are members of important mechanisms of protection against infections [456]."
"The family of NADPH oxidases (NOX), notably the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2), are a key source of ROS and are critical for the defense against infections with viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens [456–459]."
"However, as well as protecting against infection, ROS generation can result in cell and tissue damage, as a result of the interaction with cell membranes, nucleic acids, proteins, and enzymes [446, 460, 461]."
Oxidative stress is a consequence of the excessive production of oxygen reactive species or a decrease in the antioxidant defense [462].
"Oxidative stress causes cytotoxicity through structural and functional alterations, that result in the disruption of cell homeostasis [463].One of the main sources of anion superoxide (O2·−) during homeostatic conditions is the electron transport system of mitochondria."
Anion superoxide is the first ROS to be produced after oxygen enters living cells and this radical may generate many other ROS of different reactivity.
"Superoxide is produced by one electron reduction of molecular oxygen, has a short half-life, low reactivity, and does not normally result in oxidative attack of polyunsaturated lipids and DNA."
"However, defects in superoxide dismutase (SOD), a powerful enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into O2 and H2O2, can cause membrane damage due to spontaneous dismutation of O2− into H2O2, resulting in elevated levels of superoxide, which can lead to cell membrane damage because of the accumulation of this oxygen reactive species [464]."
Its instability is related to the rapid O2·− dismutation reaction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) catalyzed by SOD [465].Hydrogen peroxide is not a free radical but it can give rise to other ROS.
"Most ROS are free radicals that cause little damage due to their short half-life, but they are always reactive."
H2O2 is much more stable and less reactive than superoxide anion.
"However, it can cause cell damage at lower concentrations when compared with O2− damage [466]."
H2O2 is hydrosoluble and can diffuse across cells and reach distant targets to cause damage a long distance from its site of formation [466].
"Hydrogen peroxide is formed by O2·− dismutation, catalyzed by SOD, and an unstable intermediate, hydroperoxyl radical [467]."
"However, dismutation can also be spontaneous or can be formed through direct oxygen reduction with participation of two electrons."
"Hydrogen peroxide can generate other ROS with enhanced reactivity, such as the hydroxyl radical (OH•) or the hypohalous acid anions [450, 466, 468]."
"The direct activity of H2O2 can damage cells by crosslinking sulfhydryl groups and oxidizing ketoacids, causing inactivation of enzymes and mutation of DNA and lipids [466]."
Hydroxyl radical is highly reactive and toxic.
"With a relatively short half-life, hydroxyl radical can also react with many biomolecules, including DNA, proteins, lipids, aminoacids, sugars, and metals [466].Production of ROS by human monocytes was originally described using the NBT salt assay [469] or luminol-dependent chemiluminescence [470]."
"FCM is progressively replacing these assays [471] and has several advantages: it is rapid, sensitive, and multiparametric, and allows cell subpopulations to be studied [472]."
"However, in many of these cytofluorometric assays, samples are subjected to manipulation in the form of centrifugation, washing steps, erythrocyte lysis, and in some cases, fixation of cells or enrichment of the target cells by means of density gradients [473, 474]."
"This sample manipulation can cause both cellular depletion and artifactual activation and may result in inaccurate measurements, especially in those cases where target cells are the minority.10.3."
"Step-by-step sample preparation and assay protocol Ideally, cytofluorometric functional studies on oxidative burst should be performed in whole blood with minimal sample manipulation (stain, no-lyse, and no-wash) in order to mimic physiological conditions."
We have tested different probes to detect ROS (V.9.4.
"Materials) in leukocyte cells (lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes) using no-lyse no-wash approaches (Figs."
47 and ​and48)48) and have developed different protocols and recommendations according to the reagent used (See also Chapter V Section 16: Assessing lymphocyte metabolism through functional dyes).Open in a separate windowFigure 47.Identification of leukocytes in human whole blood using violet laser and Vybrant DyeCycle Violet stain on the Attune NxT Flow Cytometer.
Leukocytes are outnumbered by red blood cells 700-fold in whole blood and generally require enrichment by RBC lysis or gradient centrifugation prior to analysis.
"This strategy exploits the use of Vybrant DyeCycle Violet stain (DCV), a low cytotoxicity permeable DNA-specific dye that can be used for DNA content cell cycle analysis and stem cell side population by FCM."
DCV threshold levels were set empirically to exclude the large amounts of red blood cells that are found in unlysed whole blood.
A proper threshold is shown in a SSC-H versus DCV-H dotplot (left).
DCV can be excited with violet lasers and can be used for simultaneous staining with Abs.
This protocol is ideally suited to study the numbers of nucleated cells in unlysed whole blood.
"Using a gate in this figure as the parent gate (R1), the three main leukocyte cell populations (R2) in human blood are identified using classic forward and side scatter plots (right).Open in a separate windowFigure 48.Identification of leukocytes in human whole blood using violet side scatter on the flow cytometer."
Resolution of leukocytes from red blood cells in whole blood is improved by incorporating violet 405 nm side scatter.
"Using both violet and blue side scatter (left) or both violet and red side scatter (right), allows identification of leukocytes in whole blood."
"Using a gate in this figure as the parent gate, the three main leukocyte cell populations in human blood can be identified using classic forward and side scatter plots (PLTs, platelets; Ly,: lymphocytes; Mo, monocytes; Gr, granulocytes; RBCs, red blood cells).We have developed two no-lyse no-wash strategies for identifying leukocytes in whole human blood that can be used to analyze ROS production using FCM."
Approach A (Fig.
"47) uses a nucleic acid stain to label and discriminate nucleated cells from non-nucleated cells, avoiding anucleate mature RBCs."
A fluorescence threshold is applied to the nucleic acid stain detector to eliminate the non-nucleated cells from detection by the cytometer during acquisition.
Approach B uses a light scatter threshold (Fig.
48) and exploits the difference in light-absorbing properties between RBCs and leukocytes.
"RBCs contain hemoglobin, a molecule that readily absorbs violet laser (405 nm) light, whereas leukocytes and platelets/debris do not."
"This results in an unusual scatter pattern when analyzing human whole blood with both blue (488 nm) and violet (405 nm) SSC, which can be used to discriminate leukocytes from red blood cells by light scatter."
"Alternatively, red and violet SSC can also be used (Fig."
48).The general step-by-step sample preparation is as follows:Dilute 20–50 μL of EDTA anticoagulated fresh blood in 1 mL HBSS.
Adjust the leukocyte concentration to approximately 5 × 105 cells/mL.Prepare positive and negative controls.
"For positive controls, use tert-Butyl hydroperoxide 200 μM or PMA 1.63 μM."
"For negative controls, prepare a tube in the absence of any ROS inducing agent.Add the desired ROS staining reagent:Dihydrorhodamine 123 50nMTotal ROS Assay kit 1XCell ROX™ Deep Red/ Green/ Orange 500 nMAdd a nucleated cell staining reagent (e.g., Vybrant™ DyeCycle™ Violet (DCV) Stain 1 μM) to each tube if you want to perform approach A."
"To perform the approach B, this step is not required.Incubate samples for 30 min, in a dedicated water bath at 37oC, and invert tube samples gently every 5–10 min.Mini-centrifuges are ideal for quick and easy spin down."
Centrifuge the tubes shortly (10 s 16.1uf) and conserve the supernatant.
"Add 1.5 μg/mL 100 μL final volume of the desired Abs and incubate 20 min at room temperature.Add the conserved supernatant and the viability dye (e.g., DRAQ7™ 3 μM) to discriminate necrotic cells."
Incubate 10 min at room temperature.Immediately analyze the samples in the flow cytometer.
Run your isotype controls and adjust compensation properly prior to analyzing the stained sample (Section II.1: Compensation).10.4.

DCV fluorescent threshold levels were set empirically using a V-SSC versus DCV dual parameter plot to eliminate from detection the large amounts of red blood cells that are found in unlysed whole blood.
A proper threshold is shown in Fig.
47A.
"In this example, the DCV threshold values on the Attune NxT are set at 0.3 × 1000, and this setting also excludes from analysis non-nucleated cells and debris."
This value is adjusted while acquiring data and observing the position of the DCV+ cells on the bivariate dot plots such that all the nucleated blood cells are on scale with the least amount of debris appearing in these plots.
"Other specimens, such as marrow or cord blood may appear with different scatter properties and minor variations in fluorescence intensities."
"A rectangular gate R1 was drawn to enclose the DCV-positive cells, and subsequent bivariate plots were generated based on this gate.10.6."
"Pitfalls At higher sample concentrations/sample input rates, erythrocytes are frequently coincident with leukocytes, but leukocytes are very rarely coincident with each other."
"Height parameters are more accurate than area due to contributions to the area from these erythrocytes, when no-lyse no-wash methods are used."
"Relationships between extinction pulse widths, peak heights, and integrals, tend to be different for symmetric and asymmetric cells, and for single particles and doublets or multiplets, making the discrimination of pathological large cells from doublets and/or aggregates difficult."
The more conventional way of dealing with doublets is based on scatter signals.
"However, fluorescent triggering using DNA viable stains may increase single-cell discrimination."
"Moreover, fluorescence thresholding is typically required at higher sample concentrations needed for large numbers of cells per sample."
"Specific DNA fluorescent labeling can be used to rise above RBC background through fluorescence thresholding, even using lyse no-wash methods."
Scatter for fluorescence parameters chosen for thresholds in a no-lyse no-wash assay should produce the highest separation possible from the background.Important note: The influence of different blood anticoagulants on ROS production should not be ignored.
Please take into account which anticoagulants can be used in combination with your kits and reagents.
"Dihydrorhodamine 123 flow cytometric method can be used either with EDTA or heparin, without the usual necessity of a preliminary search for artifacts.10.7."
"Top tricks In this approach, non-nucleated cells are detected by the instrument during acquisition, but excluded by gating during analysis."
Care must be taken when using the method to keep event rates below instrument limitations for Poisson coincidence.
"RBC concentration in whole blood is on the order of 5 million cells/μL so whole blood must be properly diluted (1/100 or greater) to avoid instrument saturation.Dead cells often give false positive results, as they tend to bind nonspecifically to many reagents."
"Therefore, removing dead cells from your FCM data is a critical step to help ensure accurate results and analysis."
Different manufacturers market nonfixable cell viability assays for FCM to distinguish live and dead cell populations with more accuracy than FSC and SSC data.
"For more detail on this control aspect, see Section III.4: Dead cell exclusion, cell viability, and sample freezing."
"For ROS production studies, different dyes can be used on a flow cytometer based on auto-oxidation, photochemical reactions, mitochondrial respiration, cytochrome P450, NADPH oxidase, and other enzymes."
Most of these reagents are photostable fluorogenic probes that can also be detected by conventional fluorescence microscopy or high content imaging and screening.
"One of the most common cytofluorometric assays uses dihydrorhodamine 123, an uncharged and nonfluorescent ROS indicator that can passively diffuse across membranes where it is oxidized to cationic rhodamine 123, which then localizes in the mitochondria and exhibits green fluorescence [475].As shown in Fig."
"50, ROS production can be easily distinguished using these markers with a multi-laser FCM protocol using no color compensation."
This simplicity makes these no-lyse no-wash strategies even more attractive as a better choice for phenotypic and functional measurements using freshly drawn blood samples [476].Open in a separate windowFigure 50.Reactive oxygen species production.
Representative experiment of activated leukocytes in unlysed whole blood.
"Cells were stained with Vybrant DyeCycle Violet stain to discriminate nucleated cells from erythrocytes (excitation/emission (nm): 405/437), in combination with dihydrorhodamine (DHR) 123 or Total ROS 520 nm (excitation/emission (nm): 488/530) PE-CD14 (excitation/emission (nm): 561/578), APC-CD33 (Excitation/Emission (nm): 637/660), and 7-ADD (Excitation/Emission (nm): 488/647)."
"A polygonal gate was drawn to enclose the DCV-positive cells, and subsequent bivariate plots were generated based on this gate."
Cells were stimulated with PMA dissolved with DMSO and incubated in presence of DHR (upper row) or Total ROS (lower row) for 30 min at 37°C.
"Subsequently, cells were stained with DCV and PE-CD14, PECy7-CD11b, APC-CD33, and APCCy7-CD3 Abs for 20 min at room temperature."
"Following incubation, blood was diluted in HBSS and immediately analyzed on the flow cytometer."
DRAQ7™ was added to discriminate necrotic cells (data not shown).10.8.
Compensation guidelines Single color compensation controls should be used with all multicolor experiments in FCM (See Chapter II Section 1: Compensation).
Compensation controls need to be at least as bright as the sample they apply to.
Ab capture beads are ideally suited for this.
Background fluorescence should be the same for the positive and negative control populations for any given parameter.
The compensation color must be matched to the experimental color.
"Match fluorophores by brightness (values from the stain index) to density of the antigens—try to match brightest fluorophores with lowest-expressed antigens (APC-CD33), and least bright fluorophores with highest-expressed antigens (PE-CD14)."
"If multiple lasers (spatially separated) are present, spread fluorophores across the lasers to minimize spillover."
Know your instrument configuration-pick fluorophores that work with your instrumenťs optical configuration and design panels to maximize use of multilaser instruments.
"In order to have a statistically significant count of the target cells, a minimum of 50 000 DCV+ should be counted.Despite limitations, no-lyse no-wash assays are simple and fast and perhaps most importantly, they can minimize sample manipulations and consequent artifacts relevant to the biology of increasingly important assays that target fragile cell subsets and or combine live cell function with cell phenotype."
"For more than 15 years, we have used these no-lyse no-wash methods for ROS production, but also for the detection of rare cells, as well as for cell sorting experiments [477]."
"ROS production should be studied using this simple and fast methodology, but also for rare cell detection (Chapter V Section 1: Rare cells—general rules), minimal residual disease studies or human hematopoetic progenitor cell counting.11."
Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by means of Indo-1 AM11.1.
Overview Ca2+ ions play an essential role as an intracellular messenger in nearly all cellular systems and regulate a multiplicity of cellular functions [478].
"In this section, we focus on antigen receptor- mediated Ca2+ mobilization in naïve B-cells by means of Indo- 1 AM."
"However, this method can be adapted to any other cell population, lymphocyte subpopulation, or cell line that can be triggered via any surface receptor that induces Ca2+ flux.11.2."
"Introduction In the immune system, Ca2+ mobilization induces many direct processes such as activation of platelets, degranulation of mast cells, or the killing of target cells by cytolytic T cells."
"It is also an essential component of the signaling cascades downstream of several receptors, including the B- and T-cell receptors, activating Fc receptors, and chemokine receptors, and has been shown to regulate the transcription of target genes and subsequently driving processes such as proliferation, and differentiation [479–482], suggesting that Ca2+ mobilization should be a consideration in many aspects of immunological research."
"In brief, in the case of antigen receptors, binding of the antigen initiates a signaling cascade leading to the generation of the second messenger IP3."
This binds to its receptor in the ER membrane after which Ca2+ is released from the ER into the cytoplasm.
"This release is the very transient internal store release (ISR) [483, 484]."
"Reduced Ca2+ levels in the ER are sensed by STIM1/2, leading to the opening of the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels such as ORAI1 in the plasma cell membrane causing a more sustained store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) from the extracellular space into the cytoplasm (Feske et al."
; [484]).
"Based on patch clamp methods, Ca2+ currents can be measured very precisely at the single cell level [485, 486].Because this method is not feasible for many laboratories, determination of Ca2+ mobilization by means of the widely available FCM may represent an easy alternative, providing relative values of Ca2+ mobilization at the single cell level.Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) is a cell-permeant ratiometric Ca2+ indicator, used to determine intracellular Ca2+ mobilization at the single cell level [487]."
The dye is excited at 355 nm and therefore requires a true UV laser.
The Indo-1 AM emission peak at 475 nm in the absence of Ca2+ shifts to 400 nm upon binding of Ca2+ to cytosolic de-esterified Indo-1.
"Therefore, changes in the ratio of Ca2+-bound Indo-1 signal at 475 nm to Ca2+-unbound Indo-1 AM signal at 400 nm allow the immediate detection of alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Fig."
51A).Open in a separate windowFigure 51.Measuring intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in human B cells in response to anti-IgM stimulation after labeling with Indo-1 AM.
(A) The shift in Indo-1 bound to Indo-1 unbound at low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (grey) and high intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (black).
Ca2+ increase was induced in Indo-1-labeled PBMCs by addition of iono.
"(B) Setting of Indo-1 AM bound versus Indo-1 AM unbound on x-axis and y-axis, respectively."
The PMTs should be adjusted so that unstimulated cells occur on a line about 45° to the y-axis.
"(C) Gating strategy for the analysis of Ca2+ mobilization in naïve (na), IgM memory (M Mem), and switched (sw) memory B cells after stimulation with anti-IgM."
"PBMCs were labeled with Indo-1 AM and stained with CD27, CD19, IgG, and IgA After gating on living Indo-1 bound cells, lymphocytes were determined."
"Gating of CD19+ B cells is followed by differentiation of IgG/IgA−/CD27− naive (na) B cells, IgG/IgA−/CD27+ IgM Memory B cells (M Mem), and IgG/IgA+/CD27+ class switched memory B cells (sw)."
Dot plots of time versus ratio of Indo-1 bound/unbound (middle panels) and kinetics (lower panels) are shown for the three subpopulations.
After baseline acquisition anti-IgM (arrow) was added inducing a shift of Indo-1 AM bound/unbound in IgM-expressing naive and IgM Memory B cells whereas this ratio is at baseline levels in IgM- negative class switched memory B cells.
After addition of iono the ratio of Indo-1 AM bound/unbound is rapidly increasing in all subsets.
"Data were acquired with a BD LSR Fortessa™ and analyzed by FlowJo™.Alternative methods for detecting Ca2+ by FCM include methods involving the use of Fluo-3 or Fluo-4 [488, 489], either alone or in combination with Fura Red, taking advantage of excitation with a standard 488 nm laser [208, 490]."
This avoids the necessity of the more costly UV laser required for excitation of Indo-1.
"Furthermore, Fura Red can also be used on its own taking advantage of differential excitation from the violet (405 nm) and green (561 nm) lasers, enabling ratiometric measurements as for Indo-1 [491]."
Ratiometric measurements have the added advantage of controlling internally for cell size and dye uptake.
An excellent overview of the different dyes that can be used for Ca2+ analysis can be found at https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook.html.11.3.
Step-by-step sample preparation Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) See Chapter III.
"Before you start: Reagent and sample preparation, experimental design; Section 4."
Pre-enrichment of low abundant cell populations prior to acquisition/cell sorting; Section 4.2 Pre-enrichment by physical propertiesAll steps of cell isolation should be performed at room temperature with buffers and media also at room temperature.
"If this is not possible, the cells should be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min.Loading Per measurement of Ca2+ mobilization in B cells 2 × 106 PBMCs are needed."
Cells are adjusted to 10 × 106 PBMCs/mL RPMI/10% FCS.
"The respective amount of cells is loaded with 4.5 μM Indo-1 AM in the presence of 0.045% of the detergent Pluronic F-127 for 45 min at room temperature in the dark [492].Mix the cell suspension during the loading procedure by dragging the sample tubes over a tube rack every 15 min.Washing Wash twice with 5 mL RPMI/3% FCS (300 × g, 5 min, at room temperature), remove supernatant.Cell surface staining Add fluorescence-conjugated Abs (CD27, IgG, IgA, CD19).Incubate for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.Washing Wash with 4 mL RPMI/3% FCS, remove supernatant."
"Resuspend cells in 300 μL RPMI 10% FCS.The sample measurement should be performed within the next 1–2 h.Flow cytometer settings Display Indo-1 bound (FL12 405/10) and Indo-1 unbound (FL13 520/35, 445 LP) on a linear scale.View Indo-1 unbound on the y-axis and Indo-1 bound on the x-axis."
Adjust the PMT voltage so that the signals from unstimulated cells are located on a line about 45° to the y-axis (Fig.
51B).A dot plot showing time on the x-axis versus the ratio of Indo- 1 bound/unbound on the y-axis displays the kinetics of Ca2+ mobilization.
Ensure that the baseline and the maximal peak upon stimulation (iono) are within the displayed range.
"If this is not the case, the PMTs must be adjusted.Data acquisition Do not change the velocity of data acquisition during the measurementAcquire the baseline for 30 s.Remove the tube and add 10 μg/mL anti-IgM (do not stop data acquisition).Acquire for an additional 4 min.Add 1 μg/mL iono as a loading control (do not stop data acquisition)."
"In the presence of Ca2+ in the medium and proper labeling of the cells with Indo-1 AM, all cells have to show a maximal increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration."
Stop acquisition after an additional 90 s.Wash the flow cytometer thoroughly before the next tube is loaded.
"Run fresh tubes of PBS twice for 1 min each (residual iono can directly induce Ca2+ mobilization in the subsequent sample).To allow for comparison of different data sets the rate of sample flow, the time of baseline acquisition, time point of BCR stimulation and addition of iono must be kept constant between samples.11.4."

"Data analysis Depending on the required resolution of the information, data analysis can be performed by using standard acquisition software such as BD FACSDIVA™ (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or similar."
"In addition, the analysis software programs FCS Express™ from De Novo Software (Glendale, CA), Flowlogic™ from Inivai Technologies (Victoria, Australia) and FlowJo™ (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR) each offer a “kinetics” tool to analyze the acquired Ca2+ mobilization data."
An example for anti-IgM-induced Ca2+ mobilization in human B-cell subpopulations when analyzed by Flowjo™ is shown in Fig.
51C.
"Prior to further gating, Indo-1 AM-negative cells must be excluded."
"Thereafter, the commonly used gating strategy including FSC/SSC, exclusion of doublets, and gating on the specifically stained subpopulations is performed."
"Looking at the respective B-cell subpopulations in a dot plot showing the ratio of Indo-1 AM bound/unbound versus time gives a better impression than merely looking at the kinetics function, since Ca2+ kinetics provide multiple read-out parameters."
"For example, the mean peak intensity and the time to peak, imply the early phases of Ca2+ mobilization, which in B cells is essential for the induction of NF-κB and JNK [493]."
"In contrast, the decline represents the later phase, which is important for the activation of NFAT [479, 493]."
"Of note, the response of lymphocyte subpopulations is usually less homogeneous than, for example, those of cell lines."
"The percentages of responding cells can differ, and the non-responding population will strongly influence the read out, especially with regard to the mean values."
"We therefore advise you to perform an additional analysis of the parameters mentioned above, referring to the responding cells only, by setting the baseline as the threshold and excluding non-responding cells from further analysis.11.6."
"Pitfalls As with all functional assays, control samples that have ideally undergone the same pre-analytical steps as the test samples are required for Ca2+ mobilization studies."
This is especially important when samples were shipped or previously frozen.
"The optimal temperature for the investigation of Ca2+ mobilization, as for all signaling studies, is 37°C."
"However, standard instruments are usually not equipped with a heatable acquisition chamber to maintain the samples at a constant temperature of 37°C during the measurement."
"Strong fluctuations in temperature during cell preparation and between the different experiments should be avoided, since this may influence the Ca2+ flux."
"Although most cell types are capable of inducing Ca2+ mobilization at room temperature (e.g., human lymphocyte subpopulations), some cell types are more sensitive and may require 37°C to run the assay."
"In most cases, prewarming of the samples to 37°C improves Ca2+ mobilization, but subsequent cooling during the measurement may lead to changes of the Ca2+ baseline levels in some subpopulations and may thus render the analysis inaccurate."
"Therefore, we perform the entire process of loading, staining, washing, and measuring the cells at room temperature."
"Of note, during cell isolation or preparation (e.g., isolating PBMCs through Ficoll), labeling, and staining, the use of cold PBS and other media should also be avoided."
"Furthermore, mechanical force may induce Ca2+ flux."
"Therefore, carefully dragging the sample tubes over a tube rack to mix them during the entire procedure is better than vigorous shaking or vortexing of the cells.It is important to make sure that the Abs used for cell surface staining do not themselves induce Ca2+ mobilization."
This can be tested by adding the staining Ab to Indo-1 AM loaded cells and detecting the resulting Ca2+ levels.
"Since kinetics may vary, the period of acquisition for these tests should be for at least 10–15 min."
"If the Ca2+ baseline shifts in response to the staining Ab, that Ab should not be used."
"To test whether one of the staining Abs interferes with binding of the Ab used for stimulation, the measurement should be compared in the presence and absence of the respective cell surface Ab.If datasets from different days have to be compared, it is recommended that you keep the times between loading, staining, and data acquisition constant for all of the samples.The UV laser should be turned on at least 15 min beforehand to allow it to stabilize prior to use, since it is highly sensitive and more prone to fluctuation than other lasers."
"To ensure data reproducibility, it is also useful to wait a few seconds after loading the tube before recording the events."
This will provide a better definition of the baseline.
The flow rate should be kept constant throughout the measurement at low or intermediate rates.
"However, if the population of interest represents only a very small percentage of the acquired cells, it will be necessary to measure at higher speed in order to be able to record enough events/second for your analysis.It is important to note that extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ will affect Ca2+ entry, with higher concentrations leading to higher entry, and other ions (e.g., Cl−, Na+, K+) may also have an effect."
The presence of serum may influence the availability of ions and other factors.
"The phosphate present in PBS may precipitate Ca2+, also affecting extracellular Ca2+ levels."
"Depending on your experimental question, cell type and other conditions, RPMI with serum and/or PBS may not be optimal to use as the final buffer."
"Because of this, it may be helpful to make your own buffer, in which the concentrations of all ions are known."
"For washing your samples and the final measurement on the cytometer, it may help you to use HBSS solution without Ca2+ (Hanks solution), preferably self-made, and to supplement a portion of this with 2 mM Ca2+ on the day of the experiment.11.7."
Top tricks 11.7.1.
"Measuring different cell types and various subpopulations The protocol described above is in general applicable for the determination of Ca2+ mobilization in B cells, T cells, NK cells, granulocytes, monocytes, and also different cell lines."
"By adding surface markers to the Ab staining, a high resolution of the different subpopulations from peripheral blood as well as from lymphoid organs can be achieved."
"The stimuli have to be adjusted, according to the Ca2+ flux-inducing receptor."
In primary human T cells CD3 mAb must be crosslinked.
"To analyze class switched B-cell populations in parallel, anti-Ig instead of anti-IgM should be used for antigen receptor stimulation."
"While Ca2+ levels are relatively similar in T and B cells, different cell types have different intracellular Ca2+ levels."
"The appropriate PMT settings for B cells would not necessarily fit those for granulocytes or cell lines, therefore PMTs should be reset accordingly.For cell lines, it might be necessary to serum starve the cells prior to Ca2+ determination, therefore both loading and washing steps could occur in the absence of FCS, or in the presence of lower concentrations of FCS."
"Alternatively, lower concentrations of Indo-1 AM, shorter incubation times, and the omission of Pluronic F-127 can be tested, depending on the cell type and the precise application, leading to changes in the fluorescence intensity of the Indo-1.11.7.2."
Distinction between ISR and SOCE Cell culture medium usually contains Ca2+.
"To differentiate between ISR, from the ER into the cytoplasm, and SOCE, from the extracellular space into the cell, Ca2+-containing medium has to be removed by washing and resuspending the cells in Ca2+-free PBS or other Ca2+-free buffers."
"Alternatively, EGTA, a chelator that is related to EDTA but preferentially binds Ca2+ ions, can be used."
"The transient ISR is detected after the appropriate stimulation, while subsequent addition of CaCl2 during the measurement reveals the sustained SOCE12."
mRNA 12.1.
Overview The quantification of transcripts (mRNA) is key to understanding the immediate response of cells to changes.
"Furthermore, measuring transcripts is a useful alternative when Abs for protein detection are not available."
"Several techniques have been traditionally developed to quantify mRNA, such as quantitative RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis, nuclease protection assays and fluorescence in situ hybridization but none of these methods allow complex high-throughput single-cell analysis."
This section will introduce a novel FCM technique that enables simultaneous quantification of transcripts as wells as intracellular and surface proteins on a single-cell level [494–496].12.2.
"Introduction The immune system comprises many different cell types, each of them bearing specialized functions."
The response of any cell can be detected first at the transcriptional level (mRNA) and subsequently at the level of proteins translated from the mRNAs.
"Until recently, the simultaneous detection of specific nucleic acid sequences in combination with proteins on a single-cell basis was restricted to microscopy, limiting the analysis to a few hundred cells."
"Fluorescence in situ hybridization is an example of such a method, although high-throughput acquisition is not applicable."
"Flow cytometric analysis of nucleic acids, especially RNA species, including mRNA, miRNA, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and viral RNA targets, allows the high-throughput acquisition of several million cells on a single-cell basis.The PrimeFlow™ RNA Assay (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher) uses branched DNA technology (bDNA) to quantify up to four RNA targets of interest by FCM."
"bDNA technology amplifies the reporter signal instead of the target; the latter is the case, for example, for RT-PCR."
"By building a tree-like structure for reporter signal amplification, the specificity and SNR of bDNA technology increases.In principle, RNA sequence-specific probe sets consist of oligonucleotide pairs (20–40 per target) that hybridize to the target RNA sequence."
"The preamplifier, which forms the trunk of the tree, directly hybridizes to adjacent oligonucleotide pairs."
"Subsequently, multiple amplifier molecules hybridize to a single preamplifier molecule, like the branches of the tree."
"Finally, multiple fluorescently-labeled probes bind to an amplifier molecule mimicking the leaves of the tree (Fig."
52).
"According to the manufacturer's instructions, an 8000–16 000-fold amplification of the transcript is achieved after optimal assay performance.Open in a separate windowFigure 52.Schematic workflow for the quantification of transcripts by FCM using the PrimeFlowTM RNA Assay."
Step 1: Single-cell suspensions are stained for surface and intracellular proteins according to standard protocols for FCM followed by a second fixation step.
Step 2: Cells are incubated with mRNA-specific probe sets.
Step 3: The signal of the mRNA-specific probes is amplified using different sets of amplifiers and probes.
Step 4: The fluorescence of stained cells is measured using a flow cytometer and analyzed by suitable software after gating on live singlets.
The example shows the expression of intracellular gagpol mRNA and surface p24 Gag protein of J89 cells that were latently infected with HIV-1 and activated with hTNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 40 h [495].
"Steps 1–3 reproduced with permission from ThermoFisher Scientific © 2019.Currently, four fluorescent dyes that are detectable in different channels are available: Type 1/AF647, type 10/AF568, type 4/AF488, and type 6/AF750."
"Of those types, AF647 and AF568 give the strongest signal, and we recommend using those to detect RNAs with low or unknown expression."
"AF488 (medium-intensity signal) and AF750 (low-intensity signal) should be used for highly expressed RNA targets.A main advantage of the PrimeFlow™ RNA Assay is that proteins, such as lineage markers, intracellular proteins of interest, and mRNAs can be detected simultaneously."
This will allow for the quantification of transcripts and protein in defined cell types on a single-cell level.12.3.
"Step-by-step protocol The PrimeFlow™ RNA Assay can be performed in a conventional laboratory equipped with a CO2 incubator, capable of stably maintaining 40°C, a refrigerated swinging bucket centrifuge, and a flow cytometer supplied with three lasers: blue (488 nm), yellow-green (561 nm), and red (633 nm or similar).The assay can be performed in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes provided in the kit, or in 96-well V- or U-bottom plates."
The step-by-step protocol in this version is based on using 96-well V-bottom plates.

"Lyse RBCs using RBC lysis buffer (17 mM Tris pH 7.2, 144 mM NH4Cl) for 2 min."
Wash cells with PBS and filter the cell suspension through a 70-μm filter to remove debris.Be aware that collagenase treatment may affect the expression of certain cell surface antigens [497] and may be replaced by other methods for single-cell preparation from tissue include mechanical hashing and serial filtering [498].
"Moreover, manipulation of tissues ex vivo may influence both the stability and composition of mRNA in the sample [499]."
"Because the influence of the tissue-processing method on the quality and quantity of individual proteins and transcripts cannot be predicted, we recommend including test runs or validation steps wherever possible.12.3.1.4."

Controls and data analysis It is recommended to include two negative controls to allow discrimination of false positive results: (i) a sample stained with the full Ab panel but without the probe (similar to a classical FMO control) and (ii) a scrambled probe (similar to an isotype control).
"Additionally, cells known to not express the target mRNA serve as a biological control."
"Background signals can be diminished by additional washing steps between different incubations, however this might lead to cell loss.To control for correct performance of procedure, include a sample stained with the full Ab panel plus a probe for a housekeeping transcript.If the target RNA is expressed at low level, increasing the signal may be desired."
"This can be achieved by longer incubation times of target probes, PreAmp Mix, Amp Mix, and label probe."
"In addition, increasing the amount of target probes during 3 h of incubation significantly increases the signal of the target RNA detection without increasing the background.Acquired data can be analyzed with any software compatible with FCM files.12.6."
"Pitfalls Although the stability and the number of applications have improved, the technique still harbors some limitations."
"First, low expression of mRNA targets is the major pitfall, as rare expression events may not be detectable with this assay."
"Second, mutations as well as splicing variants of the target mRNA might result in signal reduction or even signal loss."
"Third, this protocol increases the autofluorescence of cells, which mostly affects FITC and PE channels."
"Fourth, several available fluorochromes are not compatible with this assay."
"This mainly affects temperature-sensitive and tandem dyes such as PerCP, PerCP-Cyanine5.5, and PerCP-eFluor710."
This restriction may hamper the design of large multicolor panels.
It is recommended testing each Ab throughout the whole procedure to determine its suitability beforehand.
"Finally, phospho-specific Abs for intracellular staining that require a methanol-based fixation are not compatible with the PrimeFlow™ RNA Assay.12.7."
"Top tricks The top tricks to clearly obtain a reliable signal or to increase the signal for the target mRNAs are:Careful design of the target probes: (i) Use a high number of target probes pro target mRNA, (ii) Use bright fluorescent target probes for mRNA with unknown or low-expression.Increase the signal: (i) Increase incubation times of target probes, PreAmp, Amp, and Label Probes, (ii) Increase concentration of target probes.Use a stable incubator and do not open the door during incubation times at 40°C."
"If available, monitor the temperature with a NIST calibrated thermometer.Use all controls suggested and perform a meticulous compensation following the instructions above.Use the RNA inhibitors included in the kit and work in a clean environment.Contact the manufacturer in advance for panel design.12.8."
"Conclusion In conclusion, the PrimeFlow™ RNA Assay opens up new options for studying complex cellular interactions, short-term responses to stimuli, or expression of a certain marker on single-cell level, when specific Abs for the target proteins are not commercially available [494–496, 500, 501] Moreover, the simultaneous quantification of mRNA and protein allows the detailed study of cellular dynamics upon certain culture conditions."
This assay also offers the possibility of high-throughput screening on a single-cell basis.13.
Transcription factors 13.1.
Introduction Cell functionality and differentiation are all controlled by transcription factors within cells that regulate gene expression.
"As these factors are generally proteins, they may be detected using an Ab directed against some specific epitope within the protein."
"In this way, detection of transcription factors is in essence no different from detecting proteins on the surface of the cell."
"However, as the proteins of interest will be located within the cell, either in the cytoplasm, within a cellular sub-compartment or in the nucleus, cells must be permeable to allow access of the Ab to its binding site."
"As the factors need to be preserved in their sub-cellular location and in their physiological condition at the time of sampling, any fixation must be very rapid and pervasive.Detection of transcription factors by FCM thus requires careful planning, with attention paid to several specific questions that will dictate the best protocols to follow."
"The most important of these questions is, “Will surface staining (i.e., phenotyping) be necessary to identify the cells of interest?”The answer to this question is critical, as it will dictate the best way to prepare the cells, allowing the antigens access to the intracellular compartment and their target."
It will also impact the choice of fluorochromes used because different fixation methods can have dramatic impact on the fluorescent molecules [502].
"The two most common fixation reagents are alcohols and aldehydes, each having their strengths and drawbacks.Alcohols, such as ethanol and methanol, or acetone, are dehydrating fixatives that both coagulate proteins (fixation) and create holes in the lipid membrane (permeabilization)."
Many of the cyclins and phospho-specific proteins are readily detectable post-alcohol fixation [503].
"Unfortunately, alcohol fixation adversely affects fluorescent proteins such as GFP, which will be affected by alcohol fixation in such a way that it will no longer be fluorescent after conformational changes or may even leach out of the cell [504].Alcohol fixation will also adversely affect commonly used fluorochromes including PE, PerCP, and APC, making these fluorochromes a poor choice for surface staining."
"Small cyclic ring fluors such as FITC, the Alexa Fluor®, and the cyanine dyes are more resistant to alcohol fixation."
"Surface markers may also be stained post-fixation if the protein structure, or at least the specific recognized sequence is unaltered by the chemical process of fixation."
"If no evidence is available, this may have to be determined empirically.Aldehyde fixation is performed usually with formaldehyde in the range 1–4% [505]."
"Aldehydes are cross-linking fixatives so they lock protein structure in place by forming crosslinks between lysine residues, forming methylene bridges."
This generally means Abs will still recognize their epitope.
"However, formaldehyde on its own is not a good permeabilizing agent and it would normally be combined with a detergent—this is the basis of many Fix and Perm kits that are on the market (although the exact composition of commercial kits is often not common knowledge due to Intellectual Property policies)."
"A range of detergents is available such as Triton X-100, lysolecithin, Nonidet-P40, and saponin."
The choice may depend on localization of the protein.
Transcription factors tend to be nuclear and the use of a stronger detergent such as Triton X-100 (generally around 0.1%) is a good choice as it can permeabilize both the plasma and the nuclear membrane.
Saponin on the other hand is not a good permeabilizing agent for nuclear factors due to its more “gentle” and reversible nature and has often seen more use in cytokine staining.
"However, it should also be noted that cytokine staining is also compatible with detergents such as NP-40 (see also Chapter III Section 5: Cell fixation and permeabilization for flow cytometric analyses) [506].It is important to note, as with any FCM protocol, the exclusion of dead cells is critical for analysis."
"Commonly used viability dyes such as PI or 7AAD rely on an intact membrane for differentiation of live versus dead cells (see Chapter III Section 4: Dead cell exclusion, cell viability, and sample freezing)."
"When targeting intracellular markers by flow, the use of fixable amine-reactive dyes must be used (see also Chapter II Section 5: Cell fixation and permeabilization for flow cytometric analyses) [201]."
"These dyes still allow for the discrimination of dead and live cells from live even after the fixation and permeabilization processes.As fixation chemically alters the cells, it will also change to some extent the autofluorescence of the cell."
Changes in morphology may be seen as alterations in light scatter patterns in a flow cytometer.
"Again, alcohols will have a more dramatic effect."
"Conversely, alcohols do not cause, in general, a change in levels of background autofluorescence that may be important if a low level specific signal is expected."
"If an aldehyde is used, fixation should be brief and cells should be stored in a phosphate buffer prior to staining as aldehydes, especially glutaraldehyde, will cause an increase in autofluorescent background.Reagent manufacturers each sell specific buffers and kits for staining of specific transcription factors, often with proprietary reagents, but these buffers have been designed to allow detection of nuclear antigens without comprising surface antigen detection."
"Some of these kits will have separate fixation and permeabilization steps, while others will be in a single solution."
"The choice of which kit or reagents to use is often dictated by the intracellular target, so reading of the technical specification of the given Ab is critical.The location of the target may also influence the fluorochrome used to label the Ab."
"Fluorochromes such as PE, APC, and PerCP and their tandems are large proteins that add considerably to the molecular weight and size of the Ab."
"This means that to detect a nuclear protein, a harsher permeabilization/fixation regime may be needed, which may also lead to selective loss of small molecules from the cell."
"But it may also mean that the comparatively larger fluorochrome will restrict access of the Ab to the nucleus altogether.In conclusion, there is not a universal protocol applicable to all transcription factors, which can be expressed in different cellular locations (see Table 11); the type of fixation, the length of fixation, the type of permeabilization, the choice of fluorochromes, and the staining protocol, including incubation times of Ab staining, must all be optimized."
"The principle advantage of FCM in this area is the ability to multiplex an assay, and by using multiple analytes be able to very specifically define subsets of interest—this will only be limited by the cytometer available."
One downside of FCM is the lack of morphological information and inability to specifically localize the fluorescence within the cell.
"If this is important then imaging using either fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy, or imaging FCM should be considered.Table 11.Most common transcription factors measured by FCM."

Staining protocol (adapted from ref.
"[507]) Staining is done in a 96-well U- or V-bottom plate.Count cells from culture/primary sample and resuspend at 10 million cells/mL, aliquot 100 μL/well (~106 viable cells per sample for staining)."
Spin down plate at 350 × g for a minimum of 3 min at room temperature.
Flick SN and vortex plate to re-suspend.
These will be the conditions for all wash steps.Optional: Stain for Live/dead and surface markers prior to fixation.
Follow manufacturer's recommendations for live/dead staining.
Make up Ab cocktail in staining buffer at optimized dilutions.
Add 100 μL per well per million cells and incubate for optimized time (1 h minimum).Add 100 μL of Staining buffer per well and spin down as in step 2.
Add 200 μL of fresh Staining buffer and spin down again.Resuspend cells in 100 μL of PBS only and pipette up and down to ensure cells are fully in suspension.
Then add 100 μL of 4% fixation buffer to final concentration of 2%.
The pre-suspension in PBS minimizes the formation of cell clumps during the fixation process.
Leave at room temperature for a minimum of 60 min.Spin down cells and treat as in step 1.Resuspend pellet in 100 μL of PERM buffer using a P200 pipette.
Incubate tubes at room temperature for exactly 5 min (stagger addition of PERM buffer if needed).Add 100 μL of Staining buffer to each well in staggered fashion to end permeabilization step.
Spin down and process as in step 2.Add 100 μL of primary Ab cocktail and mix in PBS + 2% FCS.
Incubate at room temperature for optimized time (usually 1–2 h).Add 100 μL of Staining buffer and spin down and process as in step 2.
"Repeat this wash step with 200 μL fresh Staining buffer.If necessary, incubate cells with secondary Ab cocktail mix for the optimized time (usually a minimum of 30 min) at room temperature in the dark.Wash the cells, as outlined in step 2, twice in fresh Staining buffer.Final resuspend volume should be 200–400 μL of Staining buffer.14."
"Intracellular parameters FCM is a powerful tool to measure expression levels of proteins that can be found inside cells such as transcription factors, cytoskeletal components, and apoptosis regulators, or those that are usually secreted like cytokines and chemokines."
"However, whereas proteins from the former category are normally expressed constitutively, cytokine expression usually requires restimulation of the cell, as is the case for T cells, which express cytokines ~2–24 h after T-cell receptor engagement [508, 509]."
"However, some cell types, such as innate lymphoid cells, also express cytokines constitutively [510, 511]."
"To enable the intracellular detection of otherwise secreted proteins, secretion can be blocked by Brefeldin A or Monensin that block transport of vesicles from the ER to the Golgi or within the Golgi apparatus, respectively.To activate cytokine expression, T cells can be stimulated in two ways: while cytokine expression in some memory T-cell subsets can be induced by cytokine signaling, such as IFN-γ which can be induced by IL-12 and IL-18 [512, 513], most T cells have to receive a T-cell receptor signal and a costimulatory stimulus."
"This can be achieved in a polyclonal way by agonistic Abs against CD3ε and CD28, coated to the surface of a culture vessel or in an antigen-dependent manner by the incubation with peptide-pulsed APCs."
"Alternatively, cells can be exposed to the chemicals phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin that mimic TCR signaling by activating protein kinase C/NFκB and calcineurin/NFAT pathways, respectively."
The restimulation conditions have a strong impact on the cytokine expression results and should thus be chosen carefully:PMA/iono is usually a stronger inducer of cytokine expression compared to CD3/CD28 stimulation.
"While it might be argued that this trigger is not physiological, it is very well suited to reveal the maximal cytokine expression potential of the T cells rather than their actual cytokine expression, e.g., in vivo at the time point of analysis.For PMA/iono, the Ca2+ concentration of the medium can be critical: maximal cytokine expression requires 1.5 mM of Ca2+ as present for example in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, but not in the routinely used medium RPMI 1640 (Fig."

"*p AKT, and NFκB pathways."
NFκB and MAPK activation induces the production of inflammatory and other cytokines.
"These pathways have widespread effects on cell function, which together coordinate the host response to acute bacterial infection.Open in a separate windowFigure 55.“Canonical” pathways for LPS activation of multiple signaling pathways in peripheral blood monocytes via TLR-4 (adapted from Guha and Mackman [524] and reproduced with permission)."
Inhibition of PI3K (right) by Ly294002 or GDC-0941) or of MEK 1/2 (left) by U0126 is also illustrated here.
"Also shown, in monocytes, activation of the ribosomal S6 protein is predominantly through activated ERK.Although the original canonical signaling maps indicated that LPS activates ERK in monocytes via the “classical” Ras>Raf pathway [524], in monocytes one pathway for LPS activation of ERK is via TPL-2, a MAPKKK, which is sequestered in one of the forms of IκB, is phosphorylated/activated by IKK, and released from the complex by proteasomal degradation of IκB."
"Phosphorylated TPL-2 subsequently phosphorylates/activates its downstream target, MEK 1/2, which then activates/phosphorylates ERK 1/2 [525]."
"Signaling pathways are complex, and a specific pattern or pathway seen in one type of cell does not predict the same pattern or pathway in all cells."
"Therefore, it may be important to study a broad set of specific signaling proteins/modifications for comprehensive understanding of signaling pathways in a specific cell type.15.4."
"Kinetics In studying the activation (and inactivation) of signaling pathways, it is critical to include multiple time-points within the experiment."
"For example, the phosphorylation of ERK in human bone marrow CD34+ cells (at 37°C incubation) reaches a peak and returns to unstimulated cell levels in less than 10 min [72], indicating that the dephosphorylation of P-ERK occurs rapidly in this cell population.15.5."
"Kinase and phosphatase inhibitors Specific (or relatively specific) kinase inhibitors are very useful when analyzing pathways downstream from a signaling “node.” For example, U0126 binds to MEK1/2 and prevents it from phosphorylating (activating) its downstream partner ERK1/2 (see Fig."
55).
Adding U0126 to a whole blood sample will block activation of ERK1/2 and activation of any downstream target such as ribosomal S6 protein (in monocytes).
"In addition, by comparing the level of a target phospho-epitope expressed in cells exposed to an inhibitor with that of untreated cells, it is possible to reveal background or constitutive levels of activation of a specific kinase and its downstream partners."
In Fig.
"56, whole blood was treated (here for 4 min) at 37°C with LPS alone, or with UO126 (MEK inhibitor) or with Ly294002 (PI3K inhibitor)."
"In the presence of UO126, activation of both ERK 1/2 and the downstream S6 ribosomal protein are inhibited."
"Also shown here, the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 (we have also used the more specific PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 with similar results) likewise inhibits activation of both ERK 1/2 and S6 at this time point."
"Neither inhibitor changes the responses for p38 or SAPK/JNK, although PI3K inhibition does prevent AKT activation (see below)."
These results are consistent with a model in which ERK 1/2 can be activated (in human monocytes) via PI3k>AKT.
"However, a better understanding of the responses and inhibitions of specific pathways requires monitoring the responses to different stimuli over time.Open in a separate windowFigure 56.LPS activation of the ERK pathway in human peripheral blood monocytes."
Samples were pre-incubated with the indicated inhibitors for 60 min at 37°C before the addition of LPS to all samples.
"After 4 min incubation with LPS, all samples were fixed using formaldehyde and permeabilized using Triton X-100 (see Chapter III Section 5: Cell fixation and permeabilization for flow cytometric analyses, for details on fixation and permeabilization steps)."
"Only monocyte responses are shown here, based on CD45 and CD14 gating (not shown here).As shown in Fig."
"56, after appropriate inhibitor and LPS treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilized using formaldehyde/Triton X-100, and subsequently stained using antibodies to phospho-ERK 1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein, plus CD14 and CD45 to identify monocytes (not shown in figure) and eliminate debris from the analysis."
Figure 56 demonstrates several key points mentioned above.
"LPS activates the ERK pathway rapidly, and only the monocytes showing maximal levels of ERK phosphorylation also show phosphorylation of S6 (top left)."
U0126 inhibition of ERK activation (top right) inhibits the activation of both ERK and S6.
It should be noted that the “canonical” pathway usually shown in signaling documents indicates that S6 is activated by PI3K>AKT [526].
The data shown in Fig.
"56 are consistent with the concept that activation of ribosomal S6 protein is via the ERK pathway in human peripheral blood monocytes, highlighting the need to carefully investigate the appropriate upstream activation pathways."
"Finally, both the activation of ERK and S6 are inhibited (at this time point) by the PI3 kinase inhibitor Ly294002, consistent with the concept that ERK activation in human peripheral blood monocytes can also be via AKT (not the “canonical” RAS>RAF pathway, bottom left) [524]."
"At first, these data seem inconsistent with the comment above that ERK activation in monocytes is via TPL-2 [525]."
"However, as shown below (Figure 58), there are two separate signaling pathways activating ERK, one through PI3K (early ERK activation), the other through NF-κB.Open in a separate windowFigure 58.Kinetics of LPS activation of the AKT and ERK pathways in peripheral blood monocytes."
"Whole blood samples were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 (right panel), or vehicle controls (left panel), followed by activation with LPS for 0 to 15 min at 37oC."
"P-AKT (orange, lower line in both panels) and P-ERK (red, upper line in both panels)."
"Note that in the GDC-0941 treated sample (right), the P-ERK peak seen in the untreated sample is missing (arrow, right panel).Signaling pathways (particularly phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) in normal cells are frequently activated and then rapidly inactivated."
Inactivation of a kinase involves dephosphorylation of the target phosphorylated amino acid(s) by a phosphatase.
One of the predictions of this model is that inactivation of a phosphatase should result in maintaining the effects of an activated kinase for longer time periods [527].15.6.
Simultaneous monitoring of multiple signaling pathways in the context of response kinetics The results shown above in Fig.
56 can be interpreted to indicate that both ERK and AKT pathways are activated by LPS.
"While this conclusion is correct, the use of different pathway inhibitors in conjunction with detailed kinetic analyses reveals important details of the specific pathways that are activated in human peripheral blood monocytes by LPS.Using the same logic that is commonly used to understand complex biological systems (e.g., hematopoietic cell differentiation and lineage reconstruction in bone marrow), for simultaneous measurement of multiple signaling targets, we routinely measure multiple signaling targets in each sample."
"As in all complex immunophenotyping experiments, attention to details is essential in the design and execution of these types of experiments."
"For example, large fluorophores such as PE or APC should only be used for nuclear localizing target phospho-epitopes after running preliminary experiments to ensure the Ab-conjugate can get to the target."
"Similarly, tandem dyes (PE-Cy5) should be used with caution, with appropriate controls to ensure integrity of the tandem at the time of the assay.As an illustration of simultaneous measurement of four different signaling targets, Fig."
"57 demonstrates the whole blood analysis of LPS-stimulated human peripheral blood using CD14-PE-Cy7 to detect monocytes, plus P-p38 (MAPK)-Alexa Fluor® 488, P-AKT-PE, P-ERK-Alexa Fluor® 647, and P-S6-PacBlue.Open in a separate windowFigure 57.Simultaneous measurement of four different signaling targets."
Human peripheral blood was incubated with LPS for 10 min at 37°C.
"Here, each of the measured phospho-epitopes is shown versus SSC, with the CD-14pos monocytes in red.These results demonstrate that the majority of monocytes (shown in red) are positive for all four phospho-epitopes at 10 min incubation with LPS."
As also shown in Fig.
"57, the analysis of each phospho-epitope response includes an evaluation using SSC, demonstrating that in this donor, only the monocytes show significant activation of these phospho-epitopes (in many donors, the granulocytes also show a positive P-p38 population following LPS activation, not seen here)."
"However, the details of the individual signaling pathway responses can only be appreciated using both multiple time points for LPS activation and the simultaneous use of specific pathway inhibitors."
As shown in Fig.
"58, looking at the kinetics of both P-ERK and P-AKT activation simultaneously over a 15 min period of LPS activation shows two different peaks of P-ERK expression (upper response in red in both panels): one extremely rapid, peaking at ~2–4 min (left panel), the second peaking at 8–10 min (at 37°C incubation)."
"In most (though not all) normal human donors, we see both peaks, while in a minority of donors we only see the “later” P-ERK."
"In a sample pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor (here GDC-0941, right panel), only the “early” (2–4 min) P-ERK response is inhibited."
"In contrast, pretreatment with U0126 (as shown in Fig."
"56) inhibits both the early and the late P-ERK peak, indicating that the first peak goes through PI3K, but requires P-MEK."
The second peak of activation of P-ERK actually goes through IKK>IκB>TPL-2 [525].
"Consistent with this concept, we have demonstrated that the “second” P-ERK peak is inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, such as MG-132 (inhibition of proteasomal destruction of IκB prevents the release of TPL-2, preventing it from activating MEK).The kinetics of AKT activation (Fig."
"58) demonstrate a peak at 4–8 min (left panel, lower response in orange) with a sustained response for the time period measured here."
As shown in the right panel of Fig.
"58, GDC-0941 causes complete inhibition of AKT activation, a useful internal control that strengthens the concept that the “early” ERK activation is through PI3K>AKT."
"These data also suggest that there is a constitutive activation of AKT in peripheral blood monocytes, which is inhibited by PI3K inhibitors (GDC-0941).15.7."
Sample protocol for LPS activation of human whole blood This same approach can be used to study the impact of specific signaling pathway inhibitors to determine which downstream signaling pathways are affected.
"Overall, monitoring signal transduction pathways in stimulated whole blood (and other similar types of samples) offers a unique way to test and validate Abs, specific agonists, or antagonists, using a relevant biological system."
"In addition, this approach can be used to monitor the activity of targeted therapies (inhibitors) in vivo, or to monitor the prior exposure of individuals to LPS/endotoxin [528].15.8."
"Materials 4.0–5.0 mL human whole blood collected into K2EDTA or sodium heparin, stored at room temperature until tested."
The blood sample must be used as soon as possible in order to preserve appropriate signaling capabilities.
"Sample testing should (ideally) begin within 1–4 h of collection.Directly conjugated Abs to phospho-epitopes (e.g., Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and cell surface-specific conjugates are necessary."
"We generally use multiple (generally 4) phospho-epitope specific Abs in each tube, using lower molecular weight fluorophores (e.g., Alexa Fluor® 488, or 647, Pacific Blue) for staining nuclear or ribosomal targets, and PE or APC for cytoplasmic targets."
"The same guidelines must be used here for the selection of fluorophore–Ab pairs for phospho as for other targets (e.g., use “bright” conjugates for non-abundant targets and “dim” conjugates with abundant targets).CD14-PC7CD45-KrOP-ERK-Alexa Fluor® 647 [T202/Y204], also known as P-p44/42 MAPKPP-S6-Pacific Blue [Ser235/236]P-AKT-PE [Ser 473]P-p38 MAPK-Alexa Fluor® 48815.9."

"There will be one control tube for each cell surface Ab-conjugate, and appropriate control tubes for each phospho-epitope (remember that the compensation control for each phospho-epitope target should express maximal levels of each target).For phospho-epitopes requiring methanol treatment, have a 50% methanol solution ready for use in the freezer and right before use, remove from freezer and place into an ice bucket."
"See Chapter III Section 5: Cell fixation and permeabilization for flow cytometric analyses, for details.Just before use, mix blood by inverting vacutainer tube several times, then transfer blood into a 50 mL conical tube."
Mix blood while aliquoting samples into 75 mm tubes from Step 1.Pipette 100 μL of blood sample into the bottom of each appropriately labeled tube.
Use a cotton-tipped applicator to remove any blood from the side of the tube.Add 100 ng LPS (2 μL of working dilution) to the first of the designated stimulation tubes and mix by shaking tube.
Place that tube into the water bath and start a stopwatch.
"At the appropriate time interval, add LPS to the next tube, vortex and place it into the water bath."
"Continue for all tubes in the stimulation part of the experiment.Continue to use the staggered start to place the 37°C “noLPS” control tube and the CD14-only tube into the water bath (last tubes to be placed into the 37°C water bath.At the 10 min mark, remove the first tube in the timed sequence from the water bath and add 65 μL of 10% formaldehyde to the tube."
Immediately mix well by shaking tube and place it into a tube rack.
"Continue adding 65 μL of formaldehyde to each tube in the timed sequence, mixing between each one."
Note: This is a critical step.
"Formaldehyde stops the LPS activation and fixes the cell.Incubate each tube for a total of 10 min at room temperature.After exactly 10 min of incubation in formaldehyde at room temperature, pipette 1 mL of Triton X-100 solution into each tube at the appropriate time interval, vortex well, and return tube to rack."
"After Triton is added to the last tube, vortex all tubes, place into the 37°C bath, and set timer for 15 min.After 15 min, inspect tubes for complete RBC lysis (clear nonturbid red color)."
"If lysis is incomplete, continue incubation for a maximum of 15 additional min.If lysis is still incomplete, centrifuge, decant supernatant, loosen pellet by vortexing, resuspend with 1 mL of Triton working solution, and incubate in 37°C bath for up to 30 min to obtain maximal RBC lysis.Remove tubes from the water bath, dab on paper towel to remove water from the bottom of the tubes and place in rack."
"Add 1 mL of cold (4°C) wash buffer (4% BSA/PBS) to each of the tubes, and then vortex all tubes well.Centrifuge all tubes at 500 × g for 4 min."
Remove supernatant.
"Vortex each tube to loosen pellet.Resuspend pellet by adding 1 mL of cold (4°C) wash buffer (4% BSA/PBS) to each of the tubes, and then vortex all tubes well.Centrifuge all tubes at 500 × g for 4 min."
Remove supernatant.
Vortex each tube well to loosen pelletFor phospho-epitopes that require 80% methanol treatment to “unmask” (e.g.
P-STATs)Add 1 mL of cold (4°C) 80% methanol while vortexing.
NOTE: This is critical to reduce cell aggregation.
"Place the tube on ice.After the last tube, set timer and incubate for 10 min.At the end of the incubation, centrifuge all tubes at 500 × g for 4 min."
Remove supernatant.
Vortex each tube well to loosen up the pellet.
Pipette 2 mL of cold (4°C) wash buffer (4% BSA/PBS) to each tube.Centrifuge all tubes at 500 × g for 4 min.Remove supernatant.
Note: not necessary to loosen up the pellet before the addition of antibody cocktailAdd antibodies (concentrations and volumes previously defined) and cold wash buffer to a final volume of 100 μL.
(Prepare a cocktail containing all desired Abs.
"This ensures that the Ab concentration for each tube is “identical.”) All Abs should be diluted in PBS/4% BSA (protease free).Incubate all tubes at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.At the end of the incubation, add 2 mL of cold (4°C) wash buffer (4% BSA/PBS) to each tube.Centrifuge all tubes at 500 × g for 4 min."
"Remove as much of the supernatant as possible, exercising care to preserve the cell pellet."
"Vortex each tube well to loosen up the pellet.Resuspend the cells in 350 μL of 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and store at 4°C in the dark, until sample can be analyzed."
Samples in 0.5% paraformaldehyde are stable for 24 h.16.
Assessing lymphocyte metabolism through functional dyes 16.1.
Overview The aim of this chapter is to provide rapid and simple protocols to measure lymphocyte metabolism by FCM.
We briefly layout general pathways and the relevance of some selected pathways for lymphocyte biology before going into methodological detail.
"The focus is on measuring glucose and fatty acid uptake, mt membrane potential, mt mass, and ROS.16.2."
Introduction Lymphocytes upregulate glycolysis and mt oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) during their activation [529].
"Metabolic reprogramming differs between B cells and T cells, and also within regulatory T-cell subsets [529]."
"For instance, naïve murine splenic CD4+ T cells upregulate glycolysis as well as glucose uptake and reveal a strongly enhanced ratio of glycolysis versus OxPhos upon CD3/CD28 mAb stimulation."
"In contrast, B cells upregulate both glycolysis and OxPhos upon lipopolysaccharide or anti- B-cell receptor stimulation, and therefore maintain the glycolysis/OxPhos ratio of resting B cells [530]."
"Although OxPhos ensures efficient ATP production under aerobic conditions, mitochondria also contribute cytosolic biosynthetic precursors such as acetyl-CoA and pyrimidines."
"Moreover, mitochondria are responsible for the production of ROS and cell death by the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [220]."
"Glycolysis also takes place under aerobic conditions and can be actively induced to meet the cells' energy demand, for instance in cancer cells [531], and also in certain lymphocyte subtypes, such as activated T cells [529]."
"However, regulatory T cells or resting B cells preferentially rely on fatty acid (FA) oxidation by the mt respiratory chain [530, 532] and regulatory T cells obtain fatty acids exogenously [533]."
"During hypoxia, which is encountered by lymphocytes in the bone marrow and the thymus [534, 535], ROS production by complex III of the respiratory chain has been observed [536]."
"The three cellular ROS species are superoxide anions (•O2−) that are the precursors of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH)."
"ROS at high levels can cause oxidative stress to cells by either directly inducing single- and double-stranded DNA breaks or by oxidizing amino acids in proteins, fatty acids, or enzymatic co-factors [537]."
"At low levels and under normoxic conditions, ROS represent important cellular signaling molecules; i.e., in stem cells, ROS act as second messenger to ensure cycling of the cells [537]."
The ROS species involved in intracellular signaling is H2O2 as it has a long half-life and diffuses easily [537].
Numerous proteins are redox sensors.
"For instance, the oxidation of cysteine inactivates PTEN or Akt, which are critically involved in B cell development [537]."
"Bach2, a transcription factor involved in Ab class switch recombination, is also redox-sensitive [538]."
"Thus, metabolism may reflect the activation status and predict the fate of an immune cell."
"In fact, anergic B cells are metabolically less active than naïve B cells, and even less than hyperactive B cells from “B-cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF)”- transgenic mice [530]."
"These selective examples show that immune cell metabolism comprises glycolysis, mt activity and ROS, which intersect with signaling pathways."
The gold standard to measure glycolytic and mt activities in real time is via extracellular flux analysis using a Seahorse™ device.
"However, this experimental setup requires rapid access to such a device and a substantial number of cells (up to ~2 x 106 per single experiment), which (i) might be difficult to achieve, especially when looking at rare lymphocyte subsets and (ii) may require time-consuming cell sorting beforehand."
"In addition, cell sorting over hours may alter metabolic phenotypes."
"To perform a quick first screen or to analyze complex and rare cell populations, such as bone marrow lymphocytes, without enrichment and purification, rapid flow cytometric techniques can provide first clues of whether a given treatment, genetic deletion or a cytokine alters glucose uptake, mt activity or generation of ROS.16.3."
"Experimental Design We describe here the use of cell permeable functional dyes to measure basic parameters such as: (i) glucose uptake (2- or 6-NBDG; 2- or 6-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose), (ii) fatty acid (FA) uptake (BoDipy-FA), (iii) mt mass (MitoTracker Green/Deep Red FM), (iv) mt membrane potential (mtmP) (TMRE; Tetramethylrhodamine), (v) ROS (DCFDA; 2'-7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and CellROX) and mt ROS (MitoSOX)."
"Our focus is on murine B cell analysis but all protocols can easily be adapted to the investigation of other cell types, for instance human cells."
"We found it feasible to choose one color for all dyes (for instance, FL1/green emission; 2- or 6-NBDG; MitoTracker Green FM, DCFDA) to analyze complex cell populations, such as bone marrow lymphocytes."
"Information on stock and working concentrations, solvents and commercial distrubutors for all dyes can be found in Table 13."
"This has the advantage that one single, titrated cocktail of fluorochrome-coupled Abs can be combined with each functional dye to analyze glucose uptake, mt mass, and ROS."
"Of course, the same strategy can be applied to use dyes with a different emission wavelength (MitoTracker Deep Red FM, TMRE, CellRox, MitoSOX)."
"To separate functionally distinct B cell fractions in vitro, different MitoTracker dyes can be combined [538].Table 13.Reagents (*some chemicals such as DCFDA can also be obtained from other suppliers)ReagentsDye/AbSupplier*Solvent(Stock) Working concentrationStorageStaining medium6-NBGD(Life Technologies, #C34571FOXP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer SetN/AN/AeBioscience00-5523-00Viability dyeeFluor780–eBioscience65-0865-18Anti-CD8Vio-GreenBW135/80 FabMiltenyiBW-1 35/80Anti-CD8Alexa-Fluor488SK1Biolegend344716Anti-CD8BV-510SK1Biolegend344732Anti-CD45RABV-605HI100Biolegend304133Anti-CCR7PerCP-Cy5.5G043H7Biolegend353220Anti-GZMBBv510GB11BD Biosciences563388Anti-NKG2DPECF5941D11BD Biosciences562498Anti-FOXP3PerCP-Cy5.5PCH101eBioscience45-4776-42Anti-CD14APC-eFluor78061D3eBioscience47-0149-42Anti-CD16APC-eFluor780CB16eBioscience47-0168-42Anti-CD56APC-eFluor780CMSSBeBioscience47-0567-42Anti-CD19APC-eFluor780HIB19eBioscience47-0199-42Anti-CD3PE-Cy7SK7BioLegend344816Anti-CD3APCSK7BioLegend344812Anti-CD40LBV-42124–31BioLegend310823Annexin VFITCBioLegend640906PIBioLegend421301Anti-CD4Alexa-Fluor488OKT4eBioscience53-0048-42Open in a separate windowPI: Propidium Iodide17.9.4.2."

Materials 17.9.5.
Data Analysis There are several possible approaches to analyzing proliferation data.
A common approach is to place a gate based on the nondivided peak measuring the percentage of cells that have divided at least once.
This method has the benefit of simplicity and is commonly used.
"However, this method is also insensitive as it fails to take into account the number of divisions undertaken by the dividing cells."
"For example, if two populations have 75% that have divided at least once but the first has most cells in the second peak and the second has most cells in the fourth peak, then this method will report the same result despite their being a clearly observable difference in proliferation.Modeling of the peaks to calculate the total number of cell in each peak allows the use of more sensitive measurements such as division index (the average number of divisions by each cell) or proliferation index (the average number of divisions undertaken by each dividing cell) [677]."
"It should be noted that different software uses the terms division index and proliferation index with differing definitions, so they should always be clearly defined when used, the division index used here was calculated by FlowJo software."
"When both percentage divided and division index are used to measure proliferation in the same population, it may be seen that while the results are broadly similar, division index is able to measure appreciable suppression at low Treg ratios that are less clearly different when using percentage divided (Fig."
78).
In the assay calculating the percentage suppression of antigen-driven T cells (Fig.
"76), the resulting T cell proliferation can be detectable by using the MFI of CFSE-stained T cells better than by using percentage of divided T cells or the division index."
"Indeed, because of the tiny number of T cells specific to a given epitope, they are less synchronous as compared with polyclonal T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28 mAb, in which the high number of proliferating cells allow to define peaks and to distinguish their generations (see Fig."
78) [677].
"Furthermore, the different antigen-specific cell subsets (e.g., naïve or effector T cells) display a striking difference in their baseline proliferation (without Treg) (Figs."
76 and ​and79).79).

Pitfalls Care must be taken with the timing of the assay to ensure that the cells do not proliferate to the extent that they completely lose the proliferation dye.
This will both make it impossible to resolve any proliferation past this point but also risk mixing up the responder and suppressor populations that are often separated on the basis of the proliferation dye.
To an extend inclusion of further stains such as CD25 and Foxp3 may help resolve populations but these may also be upregulated by proliferating Tconv cells.
"If this proves a problem for mice, this can be resolved by using congenic markers such as CD45.1 Tconv and CD45.2 Treg."
CD8 T-cells can also be used as responders.It should be remembered that suppressive function is not totally Treg exclusive.
"Activated non-Treg cells are capable of showing some CTLA-4 dependent suppressive function, although this is relatively weak in comparison to Treg cells."
"As a result, in some cases inclusion of known highly suppressive and non/lo-suppressive cells as control groups to allows placement of the cell population of interest on this scale.To a large extent the APC dependent suppression assay measures CTLA-4 dependent suppressive function."
"However, this is context dependent, naïve CTLA-4 deficient Treg lack detectable suppressive function, while highly activated CTLA-4 deficient Tregs are suppressive due to upregulation of other suppressive molecules post-activation [671]."
"Another common variant of this assay is to use CD3 mAb and CD28 mAb beads in place of APCs, this APC independent assay largely measures CTLA-4 independent suppressive function.The use of CD3 in the sorting strategy (Fig."
73) runs the risk of causing pre-activation of the T-cells.
"We have not found this to be a problem, but if this is a concern CD3 can be omitted without a major change in the purity of the sorted cells.As regards the killing assay of Treg cells by antigen-specific CD8+ T effector cells, care must be taken to ensure that Treg cells do not display cytotoxicity activity, as suggested in older reports [678]."
"This risk can be ruled out by the evidence showing that: (i) highly purified peripheral Treg cells, as well as Treg cells infiltrating inflamed tissues, completely lack GZMs, in contrast to CD8+ T effector cells; (ii) highly purified Treg cells are unable to kill antigen-specific CD8+ T effector cells in cytotoxicity assays in vitro (see [673])."
S. Koristka et al.
proposed that the discrepancy with older reports [678] is due to the purity of Treg cells used in the assays [679].17.9.7.
Top tricks CFSE and CTV dyes can both be used and we have not observed clear differences in results between them.
"When a Foxp3-GFP reporter mouse is used, CTV may be the optimal choice to avoid mixing up signal from GFP and CFSE."
"However, when this is not the case and blue, yellow-green, and violet lasers are all available, we find that CFSE frees up the bright fluorochrome BV421 while the blue and Yellow-green lasers allow better separation of CFSE and PE than would be possible with just a blue laser."
"In some cases, high doses of CFSE can be toxic, and the effect in a particular setting should be defined empirically.Choice of APCs: With optimization it is possible to use various cells as APCs."
"In the murine system, we have successfully used CD11c+ DCs, B220+ B-cells, and T-cell depleted splenocytes as APCs."
"For the human suppression assay, monocytes-derived DCs and T-cell depleted PBMCs have all proven effective."
"There is not necessarily one correct choice but some consideration should be given to which cell type is appropriate according to experiment in question.Since dead cells are often nonrecoverable or excluded from analysis, counting the total number of recovered Tconv cells can also be useful to understand the dynamics of the suppression system."
"Cytometric counting beads can be used in order to accurately count the cells while collecting proliferation data.Addition of exogenous IL-2: Particularly for humans some donors Tconv may proliferate poorly even in the absence of Tregs.In this case, addition of a low dose of exogenous IL-2 in the range of 10–20 IU/mL may aid proliferation while also allowing clear suppression."
Careful titration is needed as higher doses of IL-2 overwhelm Treg suppressive function.The use of a pre-enrichment bead sorting is not essential but improves the purity of the sorted populations.
This is more important when rare populations such as fraction I naïve Tregs are sorted.18.
Adoptive T and B cell transfer as a read-out for antigen-specific immune responses in mice 18.1.
"Overview For over three decades now, adoptive transfer of TCR-transgenic (TCRtg) and BCR-transgenic (BCRtg) cells, followed by challenge with cognate antigen in various experimental settings such as immunization, infection, autoimmunity, and tumors, has proven to be an elegant tool to study antigen-specific immune responses in vivo."
"These experiments have generated a wealth of information on the activation requirements, kinetics, magnitude, and effector as well as memory responses of T and B cells."
"Importantly, adoptive transfer experiments continue fueling research in these areas."
"Here, we describe critical parameters for performing adoptive transfer experiments with TCRtg and BCRtg cells and discuss advantages and disadvantages of these approaches in regards to study design and data interpretation.18.2."
Introduction Experimental immunization or infection of mice is frequently used to study immune responses in vivo.
"Using various activation marker combinations, polyclonal T and B cell responses can be easily analyzed by FCM."
"Activated T cells can be identified in mice by staining for activation markers such as CD69 or CD44 (see Chapter V, Section 17.5)."
"However, this generally does not provide information on the differentiation history or the antigen specificity of these cells."
"For the detection of antigen-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells in bulk cell populations, MHC multimers may be used in humans and mice (see Chapter V, Section 17.4)."
"While each multimer covers one antigenic specificity, thereby allowing quantification of antigen-specific cells, functional and fate-mapping assays are rather limited."
"Complementary to this approach, TCRtg T cells have been widely used for studying antigen-specific T cell responses in many in vivo settings."
The advantage of using TCRtg cells is the known specificity of these cells and their suitability for adoptive transfer experiments.
Various TCRtg mouse lines have been described in the literature.
"Prominent examples for CD8+ T cells include P14, which are specific for LCMV GP33–41 peptide [680] or OT-I, which are specific for OVA257–264 peptide [681]."
"Examples for CD4+ T cells include SMARTA, which are specific for LCMV GP61–80 peptide [682], and OT-II, which are specific for OVA323–339 peptide [683]."
All these lines are on the C57BL/6 background.
"DO11.10 mice, which are on the BALB/c background, carry a TCRtg that also recognizes OVA323–339 peptide [684]."
"For this mouse strain, a clonotypic Ab has been generated that allows detecting DO11.10 TCRtg cells without the need of additional markers such as congenes or fluorescent reporter alleles."
TCRtg mice can also be used for inducing autoimmunity.
"For example, adoptively transferred P14 TCRtg cells can kill genetically engineered LCMV GP-expressing beta cells in the pancreas, thus causing diabetes [685]."
"Another example are 2D2 mice, in which 95% of CD4+ T cells carry a TCR specific for MOG35–55 peptide [686]."
These cells can be used to track autoantigen-specific T helper cell responses in the CNS after MOG/CFA/PTX-induced active EAE.
"2D2 cells can also be activated and transferred into secondary hosts, where they are sufficient to induce full-blown disease (passive EAE)."
"While TCRtg mice usually harbor only very few Treg cells, if any, polyclonal Foxp3 reporter mice such as Foxp3-GFP may be used instead for isolation of GFP+ polyclonal Treg and Tfr cells with unknown specificity for adoptive transfer experiments.Similar to T cells, B cell responses can also be studied in detail using FCM."
"For example, activated B cells that differentiate into germinal center B cells downregulate surface IgD expression and instead express GL-7 and FAS or can be stained with the lectin PNA (see Chapter VI, Section 2.2)."
"In addition, class-switched Ab isotypes can be measured by FCM."
"Since B cells recognize their cognate antigen directly through their BCR, antigen-fluorophore complexes can be used to identify antigen-specific B cells by FCM, e.g., 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP) hapten-specific B cells with NP-PE after NP-KLH immunization or hen egg lysozyme (HEL)-APC after HEL immunization."
"However, it is often advantageous to be able to track the fate of antigen-specific naïve B cells during the entire immune response following activation of these cells."
BCRtg B cells that can be used in adoptive transfer experiments are ideally suited for this purpose.
Several BCRtg mouse lines have been described in the literature.
"Among them, HEL-specific MD4 [687], SWHEL [688], and Hy10 [689] mice as well as NP-specific B1–8 [690] mice have been used in various studies to dissect the contribution and kinetics of antigen-specific B cell responses in vivo.To limit the precursor frequencies of antigen-specific TCRtg and BCRtg cells as much as possible to physiological levels, low numbers of purified naïve TCRtg or BCRtg cells should be transferred into wild-type recipients."
"For functional questions, these donor cells can be derived from control or knock-out backgrounds and are then being compared in separate or competitive adoptive transfers into wild-type mice."
"Alternatively, for examination of extrinsic factors important for T and B cell biology, TCRtg or BCRtg B cells can be transferred into hosts that lack certain genes (i.e., knock-out mice)."
"In order to distinguish the transferred cells from host lymphocytes, it is advisable to intercross the TCRtg and BCRtg lines to different congenic alleles."
"Since wild-type C57BL/6 mice are CD45.2, TCRtg, and BCRtg cells that carry one or two alleles of the congene CD45.1 can be easily identified by FCM or immunofluorescence microscopy by staining with fluorescence-labeled Abs against CD45.1 and CD45.2."
"Using combinations of CD45.1 and CD45.1/2, it is even possible to perform competitive co-transfers into CD45.2 wild-type C57BL/6 mice, e.g., comparing control and knockout TCRtg or BCRtg cells within the same host."
"For T cells, combinations of the congenic markers Thy1.2 (CD90.2, expressed by wild-type C57BL/6 mouse T cells) and Thy1.1 (CD90.1) have been regularly used as an alternative to the CD45.2/CD45.1 system."
"While CD45 is expressed by B cells, Thy1 is not."
"Alternatively, some BCRtg mice carry different Ig heavy chain (Igh) allotypes that can be used for identification instead."
"For example, MD4 and Hy10 BCRtg B cells are Igha, which is different as compared to the Ighb background of wild-type C57BL/6 mice."
"This does not only allow for the identification of these cells by surface or intracellular staining of various Ig isotypes of Igha, but also secreted Abs derived from these cells, which are also of the Igha allotype and can be measured by ELISA."
"Another possibility is to cross TCRtg or BCRtg mouse lines to fluorescent reporter alleles, e.g., GFP, which can also be used for intravital two-photon microscopy studies."
"For short-term assays or for the assessment of cell proliferation in vivo for up to 3 to 4 days, naïve TCRtg or BCRtg cells can be labeled with CFSE, CTV or similar fluorescent dyes prior to adoptive transfer (see Chapter V, Section 18)."
BCRtg cells can also be co-transferred together with antigen-specific TCRtg cells to study the cooperation between antigen-specific B and T cells [691].
"Examples include co-transfer of OVA-specific OT-II cells and NP-specific B1–8hi cells, followed by immunization with NP-OVA in adjuvants, e.g., alum."
"If 2D2 TCRtg mice are crossed to the BCRtg mouse line Th [692], in which approximately 20% of peripheral B cells are specific for MOG, these compound animals can be used as a model for spontaneous EAE development [693].The following protocol provides a framework for adoptive transfer experiments with CD4+ and CD8+ TCRtg T cells as well as BCRtg B cells."
The protocol can be easily modified and tailored to the specific question of interest.
"An example of how this protocol can be used for the assessment of CD4+ T cell proliferation in vivo is shown in Figure 80.Open in a separate windowFigure 80.Gating strategy for the identification of CTV-labeled, Thy1.1+ OT-II cells by FCM."
Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were injected i.v.
with 5x105 naïve OT-II TCRtg CD4+ T cells.
"In this setting, such high numbers of naïve OT-II TCRtg CD4+ T cells (in contrast to classical adoptive transfer experiments with typically less than 1–5 × 104 naïve OT-II cells per mouse) are required for recovering enough events for proper cell division analyses."
"One day later, recipient mice were immunized with 5 μg OVA and 2 μg LPS in the hock."
"Three and a half days later, draining popliteal lymph nodes were dissected, single-cell suspensions were prepared and the cell surface was stained with appropriate combinations of fluorescently labeled mAbs."
"Thereafter, samples were fixed and stained with the Foxp3 transcription factor staining set and samples were then acquired on a BD LSRFortessa."
Single lymphocytes were first gated based on FSC/SSC characteristics.
"CD4+ T cells were further gated to exclude dead cells and B cells, and finally with the congenic marker Thy1.1 and CTV to differentiate transferred OT-II cells from endogenous (Thy1.1−) T cells of the recipient."
The CTV profile of the identified OT-II cells is shown in the histogram.
"To reduce the overall size of the acquisition data file, 50 000 lymphocytes were acquired first and then only TCRtg Thy1.1+ CD4+ T cells were appended to the file.18.3."
"Step-by-step sample preparation Prepare single-cell suspensions from pooled spleen and lymph nodes of TCRtg or BCRtg donor mice of interest (see Chapter III, Section 3).Enrich naïve T or B cells with magnetic beads (preferentially by negative selection) (see Chapter IV, Sections 1 and 2) and/or by cell sorting (see Chapter IV, Section 3)."
"If the scope of the study is to analyze the fate of already differentiated cells (in vivo or in vitro generated), these cells may also be used for adoptive transfer experiments.To track proliferation and expression kinetics of transferred cells, they can be optionally labeled with a cell proliferation dye (e.g., CFSE or CTV) prior to adoptive transfer (see Chapter V, Section 18).Inject TCRtg or BCRtg cells into host mice (e.g., wild-type C57BL/6), usually per i.v."
route.
"Keeping in mind to aim for the lowest feasible number of cells to be injected, adjust the required cell number to the characteristics of the specific TCRtg or BCRtg, to the immunization or infection model used, and to the intended readout (e.g., short term vs. long-term) as the number of endogenous and transferred cells can strongly influence the outcome of the experiment [694, 695]."
"While typical cell numbers will range from hundreds to hundreds of thousands, even as few as one or ten transferred cells may be sufficient for certain experimental settings [634, 696]Before challenging the transferred cells in the new host with the cognate antigen, allow the transferred cells to equilibrate in the host for a few hours to days.Immunize or infect the recipient mice with the cognate antigen."
"For protein and peptide immunizations, it is usually required to mix the antigen with an adjuvant to elicit a strong response.Analyze the adoptively transferred cells by FCM."
"To this end, prepare single cell suspensions of secondary lymphoid tissues or other tissues of interest (see Chapter III, Section 3) and stain the cells with appropriate combinations of fluorescence-labeled Abs for subsequent acquisition on a flow cytometer or cell sorter.18.4."
"Pitfalls While adoptive transfer experiments with TCRtg and BCRtg cells represent an elegant and powerful approach to study T and B cell responses in vivo, several important points need to be considered for generating valid and reproducible results:Purity of adoptively transferred cells Most often, naïve TCRtg or BCRtg cells are being used for adoptive transfer experiments."
"To purify naïve T cells from recipients, it is advisable to enrich naïve CD4+ or CD8+ T cells with magnetic bead-coupled Abs, preferentially using negative enrichment that yields untouched cells for downstream applications (see Chapter IV)."
"Alternatively, or in addition, naïve cells can be further purified using cell sorting."
"In the case of T cells, naïve CD4+ or CD8+ T cells can be sorted as CD44int/lowCD62Lhi cells."
CD25 can be included as well to exclude activated T cells and Treg cells among CD4+ cells.
"The TCR should not be stained directly (e.g., CD3ε), as this may crosslink the TCR and activate the cells."
Untouched resting B cells can be efficiently enriched using CD43 magnetic beads.Precursor frequency It is highly advisable to transfer as few TCRtg or BCRtg cells as possible.
Endogenous antigen-specific precursor frequencies are usually very low (in the range of tenth to hundreds of T cells per mouse) [694].
"Since TCRtg or BCRtg mice harbor millions of cells specific for the same antigen, it is tempting to also transfer hundreds of thousands or millions of these cells."
"However, since all these cells would compete with each other in the new host for the specific antigen after infection or immunization, such high precursor frequencies are unphysiological and results of these experiments need to be interpreted with care [634]."
"In addition, while most transferred TCRtg cells will die and disappear during the transfer procedure, only a small percentage (often less than 10%) of transferred cells will be eventually “parked” in the host."
"Nevertheless, under certain conditions, it can be required to transfer higher cell numbers in order to recover enough cells for analyses, e.g., in the case of proliferation experiments using CFSE or CTV, in which it is often difficult to recover enough cells that are within the first cell division(s) [697].High affinity TCRs and BCRs TCRtg and BCRtg cells often carry antigen receptors with very high affinities for the specific antigen, which may confound the conclusions derived from adoptive transfer experiments utilizing these cells."
"For example, the HEL-specific BCRs of MD4, SWHEL, and Hy10 BCRtg mouse lines bind HEL with extremely high affinity."
"To adapt for this problem, mutated HEL proteins and peptide sequences have been engineered that exhibit much lower binding affinities to these BCRs, thus providing a more physiological setting [698]."
"Alternatively, the HEL-related duck egg lysozyme, which exhibits lower binding affinity to these BCRs, has been used as well [689].Rejection of transferred cells Congenic markers or fluorescent proteins expressed by adoptively transferred cells can potentially facilitate rejection."
"While this may not be such a big issue for short-term experiments, long-term experiments require more careful planning and interpretation by taking this potential caveat into account."
"As an example, when transferred into CD45.2 hosts, heterozygous CD45.1/2 cells might be less prone to rejection than CD45.1 homozygous cells."
"The use of CD45.1/2 heterozygous hosts could provide an elegant solution to this problem, as CD45.1 and CD45.2 homozygous cells would be much less likely rejected in these mice."
"In addition, for critical issues, allelic marker combinations of CD45.1 and CD45.2 (or similar) may also be switched in complementary adoptive transfer experiments to test whether the same conclusions are reached."
"To further decrease the possibility of rejection, TCRtg and BCRtg mice should be bred on and/or regularly back-crossed to the same background strain of the host mice used in the adoptive transfer experiments."
"Another strategy for reducing the risk of GFP+ cells being rejected after adoptive transfer is the use of host mice that express GFP under an endogenous promotor, thus rendering these hosts tolerant towards GFP.Exclusion of dead and contaminating cells It is imperative to carefully exclude dead cells as well as “sticky” cells."
"To exclude dead cells, which often show autofluorescence and unspecific binding of fluorescently labeled antibodies, a viability dye should be incorporated in the FCM staining panel (see Chapter III, Section 4)."
"Similarly, it is advantageous to block unspecific binding by preincubation with rat or mouse serum (according to the primary antibodies used for FCM) and Fc receptor blocking reagents."
"Finally, a dump channel may be incorporated to exclude cells that are “sticky” and/or may share marker expression with the cell type of interest."
"Typical target antigens that could be used in a dump channel are CD11c, CD19 (if T cells are the cells of interest) or CD3 (if B cells are the cells of interest) and other lineage-defining markers [699]."
It is of importance to ensure that the antigen used in a dump channel is not expressed by the cells of interest though.TCRtg and BCRtg mice are often “leaky.” This means that not all T and B cells are monoclonal and some polyclonal T cells have expanded that do not express the antigen-specific tg.
"The degree of T and B cells not carrying the TCRtg and BCRtg, respectively, varies considerably between the individual mouse lines."
One possibility to generate true monoclonal TCRtg and BCRtg mice is to cross these mice onto Rag1- or Rag2-deficient backgrounds.
"This is particularly important if TCRtg T cells will be transferred into lymphopenic hosts, e.g., Rag1, Rag2, TCRαβ or CD3ε knockout mice, as naïve polyclonal T cells will undergo considerable homeostatic proliferation and may even cause disease, such as IBD after transfer of naïve CD4+ T cells into Rag1 knockout mice.18.5."
Top tricks Pre-enrichment of target populations: Low numbers of transferred cells and/or poor expansion of these cells in the host may limit recovered cell numbers that can be analysed by FCM.
"To accommodate for this problem, pre-enrichment of the adoptively transferred cells may be used before acquisition on a flow cytometer/sorter."
"Similar to the techniques described in the “Purity of adoptively transferred cells” section above, congenic TCRtg and BCRtg cells can be pre-enriched from whole host spleen or lymph node tissues by labeling with magnetic beads coupled to monoclonal Abs against the respective congenic marker (e.g., CD45.1 or Thy1.1)."
"Small bead sizes (e.g., Miltenyi MACS® or Stemcell Technologies) should be preferred over big bead sizes (Thermo Dynabeads) for this positive selection approach.VI."
Flow cytometric phenotyping of cells across species and tissues1.
T cells and their subsets 1.1.
Murine CD4 and CD8 T cells 1.1.1.
Differences in flow cytometric analysis of murine and human T cells FCM and cell sorting have been instrumental to understanding the fundamental principles of T cell differentiation.
"The analysis of human samples alongside complementary experimental animal models has given us great insights into thymic T cell selection, induction of T cell effector responses and the generation of long-lived T cell memory (See Chapter VI Section 1.11 Human CD4 and CD8 T cells)."
"Mice are the primary animal model used to investigate T cell biology and, while many of the same mechanisms apply to the differentiation of T cells in humans and mice, there are some fundamental differences in the flow cytometric analysis of human and murine T cells.One key difference is in the infection status of humans as compared to mice."
"The human immune system is challenged by a daily onslaught of microorganisms, pathogens, and foreign substances from the environment."
"This includes a vast and diverse range of potential antigen exposures, including non-persistent and persistent latent viruses, bacteria, vaccinations, neoplastically transformed cells, as well as the flora of our individual microbiota."
"These agents constantly trigger and shape the human immune system and, given that the average human lifespan is currently over 70 years in many countries, these exposures can perturb the immune system from its original naïve state over a substantial period of time."
"In contrast, most laboratory mice are used at 8–12 weeks after birth and are bred and maintained in clean facilities under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, with reduced exposure to foreign antigens and pathogens."
"Consequently, immune composition and immune cell phenotypes from adult SPF mice are more similar to that of neonatal, rather than adult, humans [700].The use of murine models has enabled researchers to selectively induce disease states and study the T cell response longitudinally at defined synchronized time points."
"To a more limited degree, this is also possible in human clinical studies, for example, those that monitor the immune response following vaccination [701, 702] or primary infection after organ transplantation [703]."
"However, the tendency to study T cell responses longitudinally in mice has driven development of terminology that is distinct from those used in human T cell biology."
"For example, murine effector T cells are generally defined as transiently expanding T cells in the effector phase of an immune response, while in humans, effector T cells are generally present at any snapshot of analysis.Finally, different immune compartments are generally more accessible in mice than in humans."
"Analysis of human T cells is largely confined to blood, whereas T cell analyses in murine models can access blood in addition to bone marrow and secondary lymphoid organs, including the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen."
"Tissues, such as skin, intestine, and bone marrow, are also more readily available for analysis in mice and, accordingly, have given us distinct and unique insights into T cell biology.1.2."
Murine Conventional αβ CD4 T cells 1.2.1.
Overview CD4 T cells are central effector cells that crosstalk with many other components of the adaptive and innate immune system.
"Primed by signals they receive during development in the thymus and in the periphery, MHCII-restricted CD4 T cells specialize functionally."
Tregs can suppress immune responses and balance between immune activation and tolerance (See also Chapter VI Section 1.6 Murine Foxp3+ regulatory T cells).
"Conventional nonregulatory CD4 T cells contribute to the efficiency of many vaccines and are vital for the protection against many infections with bacteria, parasites, and fungi, but they can also mediate autoimmune diseases."
This section focuses on conventional nonregulatory T cells and gives an overview of surface markers used to identify the diverse CD4 T cells subsets.
"Furthermore, we provide examples for the detection of transcription factors and effector functions of conventional CD4 T cells.1.2.2."
"Conventional αβ CD4 T cells: Identification and surface markers Conventional TCRαβCD4+ T cells can be identified by gating on time, scatter parameters and exclusion of duplicates and dead cells to identify viable lymphocytes and gating on CD3ε+ or TCRβ+ cells and CD4+CD8α− cells (Fig."
81).
The use of CD3ε or TCRβ as selection markers is critical for the analysis of CD4 T cells to avoid inclusion of myeloid cell subsets that express low levels of CD4.
"Additional markers may be required in specific tissues to differentiate conventional CD4 T cells from other nonconventional T cell subsets, such as from CD4+ NKT cells in the liver (See also Chapter VI Section 1.4 Murine tissue resident memory T cells)."
These markers can be used in a “dump” gate to exclude myeloid lineages and nonconventional T cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 81.Murine CD4 and CD8 T cells.
Sample gating tree for the identification of CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets from the spleen.
"Conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells can be identified by gating on time, lymphocytes according to FSC and SSC (R1, R2), exclusion of doublets (R3) and dead cells (R4) and gating on CD3ε+ or TCRβ+ cells (R4) and CD4+CD8α− cells (R5).CD4 T cell differentiation state is often defined by the expression of surface markers that correlate with the location of cells within the body."
Mature CD4 naïve T (Tn) cells are CD44loCD62Lhi and enriched in the lymphoid tissues (Fig.
81).
The L-selectin CD62L mediates attachment to endothelia and access to lymph nodes.
"Upon activation, CD4 T cells acquire CD44, which binds hyaluronan to promote access to peripheral tissues, and lose CD62L to become CD4 effector T (Teff) cells."
"Antigen-activated Teff populations expand and mediate pathogen clearance, then contract after pathogen resolution and form CD4 memory T (Tmem) populations."
"Two main circulating memory populations are central memory T (Tcm) cells, which are CD44hiCD62Lhi and reside predominantly in the lymphoid tissue, and effector memory T (Tem) cells, which are CD44hiCD62Llo and circulate more through peripheral tissues (Fig."
81).
"Additionally, noncirculating tissue-resident T cells (Trm) are primarily present in barrier tissues (See also Chapter VI Section 1.4 Murine tissue resident memory T cells).Pathogen-specific CD4 Teff (and Tmem) cells can be classified according to their phenotype and function into multiple T “helper” (Th) subsets; Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Fig."
82).
"These subsets are each equipped with a unique set of transcription factors, chemokine receptors, and effector molecules."
"However, recent research suggests that CD4 Th cell subsets are not separate lineages but a continuum of mixed functional capacities [704]."
"Alongside these conventional CD4 Th cell subsets, natural and induced T regulatory (Treg) cells have a predominant immunomodulatory phenotype with the ability to suppress autoreactive immune responses and promote resolution of active immune responses, by a variety of mechanisms (for more details See also Chapter VI Section 1.4 Murine tissue resident memory T cells).Open in a separate windowFigure 82.Schematic of murine CD4 T cell differentiation."
"An array of CD4 helper T cell subsets differentiate from CD4 Tn cells, including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, Tfh, Treg, and cytotoxic CD4 T cells."
"Molecules under each CD4 helper T cell subsets heading indicate the key effector cytokine/molecules, key transcription factor/s, and key chemokine receptors.CD4 Th cell subsets participate in a range of diverse and overlapping adaptive immune responses [705, 706]."
"Th1 cells are vital in the defense against intracellular infections, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and protozoa."
"Th2 cells protect against parasitic infections, including helminths, but also mediate much of the pathology associated with allergic reactions and correlate with asthma severity."
"Th17 cells, originally described in mice as being pathogenic in murine models of autoimmune disease [707, 708], have more recently been shown to protect against certain pathogens, including fungal infections [709]."
"Th9 and Th22 cells are relatively newly described subsets, which share some functional and developmental features with Th2 and Th17 cells, respectively."
Tfh cells crosstalk with B cells to stimulate the production of high affinity Abs in germinal center reactions.
"Intriguingly, in certain infections such as influenza, unique populations of CD4 T cells can exhibit cytolytic capacity [710].In CD4 Th cells, the expression of chemokine receptors is associated with skewing toward specific effector functions and migratory behavior."
"Rapid upregulation of CXCR3 facilitates the migration of Th1 cells to inflamed tissue sites along gradients of chemokines, such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Figs."
82 and ​and83)83) [711].
The specific interaction of CCR4 on Th2 cells with CCL17 and CCL22 is critical for movement of Tmem into the skin [712].
"Th17 preferentially utilize CCR6, also expressed by Treg cells, for migration to mucosal tissues that are enriched for CCL20 [713]."
"Tfh cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR5, which is vital in the migration of Tfh cells from the T cell zone into B cell follicles within the spleen [714] (Figs."
82 and ​and83)83) and also express high levels of PD-1 and ICOS to facilitate B cell interactions (Figure 83).Open in a separate windowFigure 83.Chemokine receptors for identification of murine CD4 subsets.
Subsets of CD4 T cells can be identified based on the expression of chemokine receptors.
"CD4 T cells were gated on lymphocytes according to scatter parameters, live cells, dump negative (CD25, NKT tetramer, B220), and CD3+/CD4+."
Examples shown include Th1 cells that express the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and CD4+ Tfh cells that express PD1 and CXCR5.1.2.3.
CD4 T cells: transcription factors The differentiation of specific CD4 Th cell lineages is induced by specific cytokine stimulation and is guided by master transcription factors (Figs.
"82 and ​and84),84), which control the expression of downstream effector molecules."
Priming of Th1 cells by IL-12 [715] and IFN-γ [716] results in expression of their master transcription factor T-bet [717] (Fig.
"84), Th2 cell priming by IL-4 [718, 719] leads to expression of GATA-3 [720] and priming by IL-23, IL-6, and TGF-β drives RORγt expression in Th17 cells [721] (Fig."
84).
"Th22 cells are regulated by expression of the transcription factor Ahr [722, 723], while Th9 cells do not appear to be regulated by an individual transcription factor but rather a combination of factors, including IRF4 and PU.1 [722, 723]."
Tfh cells are controlled by the transcription factor Bcl6 [724] (Figure 84) and the development of cytotoxic CD4 T cells can be mediated by the transcription of Eomes.Open in a separate windowFigure 84.Transcription factors for identification of murine CD4 subsets.
Subsets of CD4 T cells can be identified based on their expression of master transcription factors (TFs).
"Examples shown include Th1 cells identified by expression of T-bet, Th17 cells by RORγt, and CD4+ Tfh cells by Bcl6 expression."
Live CD3+ cells are displayed for Th1 and Th17 cells both gated as shown in Fig.
81.
"For analysis of Bcl2 expression, within live CD3+/ CD4+ cells Tfh cells (CXCR5+/CD44 high) and naïve T cells (TN CXCR5−/CD44 low) are displayed.Transcription factors are mainly located intranuclearly and, to assess these by FCM, staining buffers are used that efficiently permeabilize the nucleus and enable intranuclear access of Abs."
"When no reliable Abs are available, reporter mice are a valuable tool for the flow cytometric analysis of transcription factor expression [725]."
"Additionally, the use of reporter constructs can also enable functional assays based on transcription factor expression that are not possible with fixed and permeabilized cells.1.2.3.1."

CD4 T cells: effector functions and antigen-specificity Most memory CD4 T cells are quiescent in steady state.
"Consequently, analysis of CD4 Th cell functional capacity by FCM usually involves in vitro restimulation and subsequent effector protein profiling by intracellular staining."
"The hallmark cytokines for CD4 Th cell subsets are as follows; Th1 cells express IFN-γ [726], Th2 cells express IL-4, IL-5, and/or IL-13, Th17 cells express IL-17 [727], Th9 cells express IL-9, Th22 cells express IL-22, and Tfh cells express IL-21 (Fig."
85).
"Although yet to be fully characterized, cytotoxic CD4 T cells have been identified through the expression of cytolytic molecules such as perforin [710]."
"CD4 T cells also upregulate the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40L after activation [614], which is crucial for their T helper functions [691, 728].Open in a separate windowFigure 85.Effector molecules produced by murine CD4 T cells."
CD4 helper T cell subsets produce distinct sets of cytokines.
"To analyze production of cytokines, in vitro generated Th-subsets were restimulated with PMA and Iono in the presence of BrefA."
"Examples shown include Th1 cells that produce IFN-γ, Th2 cells that produce IL-4 and Th17 cells that produce IL-17."
All dot plots are gated on live CD4+ T cells as shown in Fig.
81.To unleash and detect their effector function CD4 T cells can be stimulated polyclonally using CD3ε mAb to drive TCR signaling or using the phorbol ester PMA together with Iono to bypass TCR signaling and activate protein kinase C. CD4 T cells can be stimulated in an antigen-specific manner with their cognate peptide presented by MHCII.
"Antigen can be provided in in vitro stimulation either as a purified short peptide containing the relevant epitope, or as more complex antigens; live or killed pathogens, pathogen lysates, full-length proteins, or long peptides, which are then processed into short peptides and directly presented on MHCII by professional APCs."
"Restimulation with more complex antigen therefore requires the presence of APCs and, as a result, whole splenocyte preparations or sorted CD4 T cells with addition of peptide-pulsed APCs should be used to assess responses to complex antigen."
"Additionally, synthetic MHCII dimers loaded with peptide can be generated and covalently linked to beads or coated onto plates for in vitro restimulation assays."
"After activation, T cells start to produce and/or secrete effector molecules including co-stimulatory surface molecules, cytokines, and chemokines (see also Chapter V Section 17.5 Functional Read-outs).To identify cytokine production on single cell levela and increase the signal, cells are treated with protein transport inhibitors such as brefeldin A (BrefA) or monensin during the stimulation to allow accumulation of cytokines and activation-associated surface molecules in responding T cells."
"Of note, when CD4 T cells are stimulated with complex antigen, protein transport inhibitors should be added after a delay (~2 h) to permit sufficient processing of peptide, loading onto MHCII and surface export of peptide/MHCII complexes."
"In addition, as extended exposure of cells to these inhibitors can be toxic, it is optimal to limit exposure."
"The stimulation time depends on the kinetic of the detected cytokine, but 4–6 h is usually sufficient to detect cytokines including IFN-γ and TNF by intracellular cytokine staining."
"Administration of monensin or BrefA to mice during an active immune response and analysis shortly after administration can be used to assess cytokine production directly ex vivo [729] (see also Chapter V Section 17.5 Functional Read-outs).The detection of effector functions by FCM can be used to gain information about the properties of specific T cell subsets, but it is also utilized to enumerate antigen-specific CD4 T cells."
"To evaluate the total magnitude of an antigen-specific response using functional measures, an effector response should be selected that will be present in the majority of antigen-specific CD4 T cells following restimulation."
"A particularly useful marker for assessing total response magnitude for CD4 T cells is CD40L, as this marker is rapidly expressed on CD4 T cells after activation [730]."
"Unfortunately, it can be difficult to stain for CD40L, as it is transiently expressed on the cell surface and then rapidly secreted or internalized and degraded after interaction with its ligand, CD40."
"To circumvent this issue, cells can be either stained intracellularly for CD40L in the presence of BrefA or stimulated in vitro in the presence of both fluorescently labeled Ab against CD40L and blocking CD40 Ab [730]."
"Staining for CD40L in this way thereby permits evaluation of the majority of the antigen-specific CD4 T cell response.The simultaneous detection of multiple activation markers or cytokines can aid the detection of low frequency responses, due to the decreased background."
"For the identification of live CD4 T cells producing a certain cytokine, a cytokine secretion assay can be used (see also Chapter V Section 17.6 Live cytokine-producing cell sorting with Cytokine Secretion Assay)."
"In Chapter V Section 17.5 Functional Read-outs, additional information on antigen-specific T cell stimulation can be found.Antigen-specific CD4 T cells can be detected indirectly using in vitro restimulation with defined antigens, but antigen-specific CD4 T cells can also be directly identified, analyzed, and tracked in mice using a number of methods."
"First, CD4 T cells specific for a given antigen can be detected by MHCII tetramers/multimers (see also Chapter V Section 17.4 MHC Multimers)."
"Of note, tetramer staining can exhibit nonspecific binding and high background."
"To improve identification of low frequency tetramer+ T cells, staining with the same MHCII tetramer labeled with two different fluorophores can be used (see also Chapter V Section 17.4 MHC Multimers)."
Another strategy to track antigen-specific responses in vivo is to transfer congenically labeled or fluorescently labeled TCR transgenic T cells.
"Different transgenic mouse strains expressing TCRs specific for a number of antigens and derived from CD4 T cells have been developed, including ovalbumin (OT-II), LCMV glycoprotein (SMARTA), and malarial antigen (pBT-II)."
Allelic variants of the cell surface molecules CD90 (Thy-1) and CD45 (Ly-5) can be distinguished with selective Abs and allow tracking of adoptively transferred T cells in congenically distinct recipients.
"T cells can also be genetically modified to stably express fluorescent proteins, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), yellow (Y)FP, and red (R)FP, to track transferred cells or act as reporters for deletion or expression of genes in genetically modified mice."
"Fluorescent dyes, such as carboxy fluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and cell trace/tracker violet (CTV) (see Chapter V Section 18 Adoptive T cell transfers as a readout for Ag-specific immune responses), can be used to label cells, which are then transferred into hosts to track migration or cell division in vivo, although the fluorescent signal from these dyes is lost with protein turnover and so they can only be detected for a finite period."
Functional indicators of antigen-specificity can also be used.
"Activated T cells that are actively dividing, can be identified in vivo or in vitro by uptake of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or by intranuclear staining with the proliferation-associated marker Ki-67.1.3."
Murine Conventional αβ CD8 T cells 1.3.1.
"Overview MHCI-restricted CD8 T cells are one of the central effector cell populations of the adaptive immune system and contribute to protection against viruses, intracellular bacteria, and malignant cells."
"In this section, we provide examples how to identify conventional CD8 T cells and use surface markers to determine functionally distinct populations of CD8 T cells in steady state and during an immune response."
"Furthermore, we give an overview of methods that can be used to analyze transcription factors, track antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses, and measure CD8 T cell effector function.1.3.2."
Conventional αβ CD8 T cells Identification and surface markers.
"Conventional TCRαβ CD8+ T cells can be identified by gating according to time, FSC and SSC, exclusion of doublets and dead cells, gating on CD3ε+ or TCRβ+ cells and finally gating on CD4−CD8α+ cells (Fig."
81).
Gating on CD3ε+ or TCRβ+ T cells is useful to exclude myeloid cells or NK cells that express CD8α.
"Of note, this gating strategy can lead to the inclusion of unconventional T cells, such as intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), γδ T cells, NK T cells, and MAIT cells (see also Chapter VI Sections 1.7–1.10), as some of these cells express a CD8αα homodimer."
"These unconventional T cell populations can together comprise up to 50% of the CD8 T cell populations in some peripheral tissues, such as the small intestine."
"To avoid this misclassification, CD8β Abs should be included in gating strategies to exclude unconventional T cells that do not express this marker."
"The use of CD8β Abs can, however, reduce binding of MHCI tetramers and there by limit the identification of antigen-specific CD8 T cells [731]."
These factors should therefore be taken into consideration when identifying antigen-specific populations in tissues that are rich in unconventional T cells populations.The differentiation state of CD8 T cells is defined by CD44 and CD62L expression (Figs.
81 and ​and86).86).
Naïve CD8 T cells (Tn) are CD44loCD62Lhi.
"After infection or immunization, antigen-activated CD8 T cells upregulate expression of CD44 and lose CD62L during differentiation into CD8 Teff cells (CD44hiCD62Llo) (Fig."
86).
The expression of additional surface markers during activation and expansion can be indicative of cellular fate in developing CD8 Teff cells.
"Two such markers are CD127, which is the IL-7 receptor α chain that promotes T cell survival in the periphery, and KLRG1, which is upregulated with strong or sustained antigen encounter and regarded as a marker of terminal differentiation (Figure 87)."
"Antigen-specific CD8 T cells derived from the effector phase of a response can express various combinations of CD127 and KLRG1, which define either short-lived effector cells (SLEC; CD127−KLRG1+), which are lost during the contraction phase of the immune response, or memory precursor effector cells (MPEC; CD127+KLRG1−), which are more likely to persist and contribute to memory populations [732, 733]."
"Of note, repeated antigenic stimulation, such as during live or prime boost vaccination, can drive accumulation of a CD127+KLRG1+ population [734], although their functionality and memory potential is not well defined.Open in a separate windowFigure 86.Discriminating murine CD8 T cell subsets."
"The expression of CD44, CD62L, and CD69 can be used to identify CD8 T cell populations in the different phases of the immune response."
CD8 T cells displayed in the top row were gated as shown in Fig.
81.
Naïve mice mainly contain naïve CD8 T cells.
"Pathogen-specific T cells can be identified using tetramer staining, here GP33-specific CD8 T cells after LCMV infection."
"During the effector phase (d8 post infection), the majority of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells upregulate CD44 and downregulate CD62L."
"In the memory phase (day 30+ post infection), T cells retain high expression of CD44 and can be divided in Tcm, Tem, and Trm using expression of CD62L and CD69, with distinct contribution of Tcm, Tem, and Trm in different tissues.Open in a separate windowFigure 87.Delineating murine SLEC and MPEC populations."
The expression of KLRG1 and CD127 can be used to differentiate SLECs (KLRG1+CD127−) from MPECs (KLRG1−CD127+).
Plots are gated on CD8α+ T cells as in Fig.
"81 (total CD8 T cells, top two rows) and additionally on tetramer+ cells as in Fig."
86 (bottom row).
"Cells are derived from peripheral blood at the peak (day 27, left) or memory timepoint (day 230, right) post-vaccination with recombinant adenoviral vector expressing SIV-Gag as a target antigen.After resolution of infection, the CD8 Teff cell population contracts and memory populations begin to form."
"Similar to CD4 T cells, CD8 Tmem cells are often defined as Tcm cells (CD44hiCD62Lhi) and Tem cells (CD44hiCD62Llo), as well as tissue resident memory cells (Trm; CD44hiCD62LloCD69hi; see Chapter VI Section 1.4 Murine tissue resident memory T cells) (Figure 86)."
"Additionally, the differential expression of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 can been used to identify CX3CR1int peripheral memory T cells (Tpm), which have direct access to peripheral tissues for surveillance [735].Of note, cytokine stimulation in the absence of antigen stimulation can upregulate memory markers in antigen-naïve CD8 T cells."
"These virtual memory CD8 T cells (Tvm; CD44hi CD49dlo) acquire CD44 expression in the periphery in response to IL-15 stimulation but do not upregulate CD49d, a subunit of very-late activation antigen (VLA)-4 [736]."
"Other Tvm cell markers include high expression of Eomes, Bcl-2, CD122, and CD127."
"While Tvm cells are antigen-naïve, they are functionally distinct from CD8 Tn cells [737]."
"Crucially, Tvm cells are also CD62Lhi."
"As a result, CD44hiCD62LhiCD49dlo Tvm cells are often included in gates for CD44hiCD62LhiCD49dhi Tcm cells (Figure 88), when CD49d is not included in gating strategies or when a marker to identify antigen-specific Tcm cells, such as tetramer staining, is not used."
"Given the unique functional profile of Tvm cells, this has led to misattribution of Tvm cell qualities to the Tcm cell compartment [738]."
"Care should be taken to properly identify Tcm cells versus Tvm cells, especially during aging when virtual memory cells become more dominant (see also Chapter VI Section 1.5).Open in a separate windowFigure 88.Discriminating murine Tcm cells from Tvm cells."
"The expression of CD44, CD62L, and CD49d can be used to differentiate antigen-experienced Tcm cells from antigen-inexperienced Tvm cells."
Tcm cells are CD44hiCD62LhiCD49dhi while Tvm cells are CD44hiCD62LhiCD49dlo.
Shown are splenocytes from 3-month-old naïve or flu-infected (day 60 post-infection) C57BL/6 mice.

[739].1.3.3.
"CD8 T cells: Transcription factors The differentiation of CD8 T cells from Tn into Teff, Tcm, Tem, and Trm cells is coordinated by a network of transcription factors."
"Tn cells exhibit high expression of Bach2, which maintains naïvety and multipotency [740]."
"After activation, some transcription factors favor Teff cell differentiation, such as Tbet, Id2, Blimp1, while others favor Tcm or Tem cell differentiation, such as Eomes, Bcl6, and Id3."
Eomes in particular has been correlated with Tcm cell development [741] but it is also crucial in Tvm cell development [736].
"Additionally, Blimp and Hobit (homolog of Blimp1 in T cells) mediate Trm generation [742]."
"To assess transcription factors by FCM, intranuclear staining is used (see also Chapter V Section 13 Transcription factors).1.3.4."
"CD8 T cells: Effector functions and antigen specificity During activation, CD8 Tn cells start to express surface molecules and produce and secrete proteins that are necessary for their effector function."
Directed killing of infected or malignant cells is the main effector function of activated CD8 Teff cells.
"This cytotoxicity is typically mediated by secretion of cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF, the release of cytotoxic granules containing granzymes and perforin, and/or surface expression of FasL, which can induce apoptosis of Fas expressing cells."
"Similar to CD4 T cells, different subsets of CD8 cytotoxic T (Tc) cells have been described, including Tc1, Tc2, Tc9, and Tc17 cells [743], and a subset of CD8 T cells has been observed that can mediate help via CD40L [744]."
"Some effector functions, such as constitutive Granzyme B expression, can be directly analyzed in resting Tmem, while most cytokines are only produced after reactivation.To assess cytokine production quantitatively and qualitatively, intracellular cytokine staining is commonly used."
Like CD4 T cells (See Chapter VI Section 1.2.4.
"CD4 T cells: effector functions and antigen-specificity), cytokine production in CD8 T cells is generally analyzed after in vitro restimulation, either polyclonally using PMA/Ionomycin or CD3/28 mAb, or in an antigen-specific manner using protein (i.e., purified protein, pathogen lysate, or live pathogen) or peptide."
"Of note, antigen-specific restimulation of CD8 T cells involves stimulating the cells with their cognate antigen presented on MHCI."
"While complex protein antigen can be used to efficiently stimulate CD4 T cells, cross-presentation of exogenous complex protein antigen on MHCI by APCs is a relatively inefficient process in vitro and is generally less suitable for restimulation of CD8 T cells."
"In contrast, short peptides are very efficiently loaded onto MHCI (and II) and restimulation with peptides that contain known epitopes is therefore an effective way to induce and assess CD8 T cell responses."
"Alternatively, cells directly infected with bacteria/virus or cell lines expressing MHCI-peptide conjugates, such as SAMBOK (MEC.B7.SigOVA) [745] or RMA-S, can be used to stimulate CD8 T cells, as these cells exhibit efficient presentation of peptide on MHCI.During stimulation, cells will start to express cytokines and other effector molecules."
"To drive the accumulation of these molecules within the cell and increase the detection of secreted effector molecules, protein inhibitors like BrefA or monensin are used during the activation."
"These protein transport inhibitors are toxic; thus, it is optimal to limit the time of cell exposure."
"Typically, 4–6 h are used to accumulate cytokines like IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF for detection by staining (Fig."
89a).
"In addition, BrefA or monensin can be administered to mice during an active immune response, with mice euthanized shortly after administration and immediate analysis of cytokine production directly ex vivo [729]."
"The advantage of this approach is that it allows measurement of cytokine production with in situ antigen presentation, which is more relevant to understanding immune priming in the lymph node and site of infection.Open in a separate windowFigure 89.Effector molecules produced by murine CD8 T cells (A) Splenocytes of virus-immune mice were stimulated with peptide for 6 h in the presence of BrefA to identify virus-specific CD8 T cells based on their cytokine expression and degranulation using CD107a (gated on live CD8α+ T cells)."
"(B) Virus-specific CD8 T cells from different tissues were stained Granzyme B (gated on CD8α+ T cells as in Figure 81, with identification of transferred OT1 CD8 T cells using congenic markers CD45.1 /CD45.2).T cells can engage multiple effector mechanisms after activation."
"The simultaneous detection of multiple activation markers or cytokines can aid the detection of low frequency responses, due to decreased background (Fig."
"89A), but it also permits the assessment of a characteristic known as poly- or multifunctionality."
"Multifunctionality refers to T cells that express more than one effector molecule or cytokine simultaneously upon stimulation and can be assessed through Boolean gating, processed with software called Pestle and visualized with software called SPICE."
"Alternatively, newer FlowJo plugins such as SPADE analysis and Cytobank, can facilitate analysis of multiparametric data.Cytotoxic potential can be assessed directly ex vivo by intracellular staining for cytotoxic proteins such as granzyme B and perforin."
"CD8 Teff and some Tmem cells contain vesicles of preformed cytotoxic granules, including granzymes and perforin, that are detected via intracellular staining directly ex vivo without the need for stimulation (see protocol, Fig."
89B).
"This approach is optimal, as stimulation can cause CD8 T cell degranulation, which can lead to a reduction in the amount of granzyme B or perforin per cell and a loss of fluorescence intensity and staining resolution."
Cytotoxic capacity can be directly assessed using in vitro or in vivo killing assays (see also Chapter V Section 17.8 Cytotoxicity).
"In these assays, fluorescently labeled target cells loaded with a target peptide are mixed at a 1:1 ratio with fluorescently labeled control cells loaded with an irrelevant peptide."
The target/control mix is either co-incubated in vitro with antigen-specific CD8 T cells at varying ratios or administered intravenously to immune animals.
A reduction in the relative frequency of target versus control cells acts as a measure of antigen-specific CD8 Teff cell cytotoxic capacity.
"Finally, degranulation capacity can also be assessed."
"When a CD8 T cell is stimulated, cytotoxic granules can be released at the cell surface and lysosomal markers such as CD107a and -b become transiently accessible at the cell surface before being recycled."
"To stain these markers as a measure of degranulation, fluorescently labeled Abs for CD107a and -b are included during restimulation and monensin should be used to neutralize lysosomal pH and prevent protein degradation (Fig."
"89A).To identify, analyze, and track antigen-specific CD8 T cells in mice, a number of methods previously described in the section on CD4 Teff cell functions, can be used (see also Chapter VI Section 1.2.4 CD4 T cells: effector functions and antigen specificity)."
"Briefly, antigen-specific CD8 T cells can be identified directly ex vivo using MHCI tetramers/multimers."
CD8 Teff cells can be restimulated with cognate antigen and proliferation or cytokine production can be used to indirectly identify antigen-specific CD8 T cells.
"Antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses can also be tracked using transfer of congenically marked or fluorescently labeled TCR transgenic CD8 T cells from mouse strains such as OT-I, p14, and gBT-I and subsequent challenge with their cognate antigen."
"During an ongoing immune response, activation markers such as CD11a and CD49d [746], as well as markers of proliferation (BrdU or Ki67) can be used to directly identify antigen-experienced CD8 cells ex vivo.1.3.5."

Murine tissue resident memory T cells 1.4.1.
"Overview Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) cells are noncirculating T cells that form the first line of defense against reinfection in tissues [747, 748]."
"They are enriched in barrier tissues, such as the lung, skin, and intestine, but they are also present in internal organs, such as brain, liver, bone marrow, white adipose tissue, and lymphoid organs."
"The tissue residency phenotype was initially described for CD8 T cells, but analogous tissue residency programs for CD4 T cells and other lymphocyte populations are currently being defined [749].1.4.2."
Methods to identify and analyze tissue resident T cells Most tissue resident T cells are located within a dense network of parenchymal cells and extracellular matrix.
This cellular network needs to be dissociated to analyze the lymphocytes in a single-cell suspension by FCM.
It is important to note that the isolation procedure of murine T cells from tissues can have a significant impact on cell viability and detected phenotype.
"Enzymes like collagenase and dispase, which are used to enzymatically dissociate tissue, can cleave off lineage-defining markers such as CD4 and CD8 [750]."
"Additionally, tissue dissociation not only causes sheer stress and destruction, but signals released during the dissociation of tissue can influence the phenotype, function, and viability of CD4 and CD8 T cells."
"For example, activation of the danger receptor P2RX7 by extracellular NAD or ATP, released by dying cells during processing, can lead to shedding of surface molecules such as CD62L and CD27, the masking of CD8β and the induction of cell death in susceptible cells like Treg, NKT, and Trm cells [751–753]."
This is especially important when T cells are used in functional assays.
"As a result, the method of tissue dissociation should be carefully chosen and viability of cell preparations used in FCM should always be assessed.In many peripheral tissues, unconventional T cells are increased and can even dominate (see also Chapter VI Sections 1.7–10), which is important to consider when identifying Trm cell populations."
These unconventional T cells can have overlapping expression patterns with conventional TCRαβ CD4 and CD8 T cells for basic surface markers.
"For example, in liver and spleen, the CD3+ CD4+ gate is composed of both conventional TCRαβ CD4 T cells and a population of NKT cells with a tissue resident phenotype (Fig."
90).
"Similarly, in the small intestine, the CD3+ CD8α+ gate for intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) can include conventional TCRαβ CD8αβ T cells and CD8αα IELs and γδ T cells."
"Therefore, careful selection of the surface markers is key for the correct identification of target cells, particularly across tissues.Open in a separate windowFigure 90.Unconventional and conventional murine T cells can have overlapping phenotypes."
"Splenocytes were gated on scatter parameters (see Figure 81), live, CD3+/CD4+ T cells."
Staining with CD1d PBS-57 tetramer identifies NKT cells that mainly express CD69.Their location and signals of the local microenvironment determine the expression profile of T cells.
"Accordingly, the physiologically quite diverse parenchyma of tissues can drive a tissue-specific phenotype Trm and expression of surface molecules might differ per organ [747]."
"CD69 is constitutively expressed by many Trm cells, it is functionally important for their residency and it is therefore a commonly used marker for Trm identification (Figs."
86 and ​and91).91).
The chemokine receptor CXCR6 (Fig.
"91), immunoglobulin CD101 and CD49a, the α-chain of the α1β1 integrin (VLA-1), are also highly expressed on Trm cells in many tissues."
CD8 Trm cells in epithelial and neuronal tissues can also express CD103 (Fig.
"91), which is the α-chain of the αEβ7 integrin [747]."
"CD103 is also expressed by a subset of CD8 Tn cells, which makes the use of CD44 or CD62L essential to discriminate between CD8 Trm and Tn cells."
"While the majority of Trm cells throughout different tissues constitutively express CD69, parabiosis and in vivo labeling experiments have highlighted that there are CD69− cells that reside long-term in tissues [754].Open in a separate windowFigure 91.Identifying Trm cells."
"Expression of CD69, CD103, and CXCR6 can be used to identify Trm."
"Lymphocytes from different tissues of LCMV-immune mice (d30+ post infection) were isolated and LCMV-specific memory T cells identified as live, CD8α+, tetramer+ (see Figs."
81 and ​and8484).In vivo labeling offers an alternative way of Trm identification by providing information about the location of T cells.
"During in vivo labeling, fluorescently labeled Abs directed against CD4, CD8 or pan-T cell markers, such as CD90 and CD45, are injected intravenously shortly before tissue harvest [755]."
"This brief exposure labels leukocytes in circulation, which can be used to distinguish between the labeled cells in the vasculature of a tissue and unlabeled T cells located within the tissue itself."
These unlabeled T cells are therefore enriched for Trm cells and this approach can be particularly important when working with highly vascularized tissue such as the lung.1.4.3.

Immune senescence (aging) in murine T cells 1.5.1.
"Overview Aging leads to loss of immune functionality with a well-documented impact on adaptive immunity, and in particular the T cell lineage [756]."
Such changes have shown similarities in humans and mice.
"Therefore, this chapter will focus on the phenotyping of T cells in models of aging in mice.1.5.2."
"Introduction To study immune aging in mouse models, we need to consider the overlaps and the differences between the aging process in mice and humans."
"Such differences may be reflections of intrinsic differences between the two species (e.g., in lifespan, body mass, telomere length, or telomerase activity [757]), or of the fact that humans are observed in the context of environmental exposures of the real world, whereas mice are typically studied in controlled and sterile environments of SPF facilities."
"Therefore, long-term exposure of mice to ubiquitous environmental microorganisms may reflect natural aging processes better than their maintenance in sterile environments [758, 759]."
"When working with mice, 18 months of age or older is considered truly aged [760], as many mouse strains survive longer than 600 days in standard SPF housing [761]."
"While 3-month-old young mice have high frequencies of naïve T cells in blood and lymphoid tissue, the relative frequency (Fig."
92) and absolute counts of naïve T cells decline substantially with age as the thymus involutes.
"In contrast, the frequency (Fig."
"92) and counts of memory T cell subsets, particularly more differentiated populations, increase with age as the collective history of antigenic encounters makes a mark on the aging host.Open in a separate windowFigure 92.Gating strategy used to define TN, TVM, TCM, and TEM CD8 T cell subsets in naïve mice, using splenocytes from naïve SPF 3 month old and 18 month old C57BL/6J mice."
"(A) Gating strategy, where cells are gated on singlets, lymphocytes, live, dump-, CD8+ T cells, and then (B) CD44 versus CD62L then CD49d or (C) CD44 versus CD49d to define the populations indicated in the key."
"Frequencies indicate the frequency of indicated subsets within the CD8 T cell population.Phenotyping of naïve and memory T cell subsets by FCM relies on a combination of markers that are acquired or lost during T cell differentiation, from naïve and memory to terminally differentiated T cells [762]."
"Some markers that are used to identify naïve and memory T cell subsets in humans such as CD45RA [762] are not suitable for phenotyping murine T cell subsets, mainly because they do not allow reasonable separation in discrete positive and negative fractions."
"As a result, markers such as CD44 and CD62L or CCR7 are used in mice to identify naïve (TN), central memory (TCM), and effector memory (TEM)/effector (TEFF) subsets, as well as KLRG1 and CD127, which are used to identify memory precursor effector cells (MPEC) and the short-lived effector cells (SLEC) populations, as described previously (See Chapter VI Section 1.1 Murine CD4 and CD8 T cells, Section 1.4 Murine tissue resident memory T cells).In addition to these classical T cell subsets, we can assess senescence markers in T cells."
"Some surface markers used in humans such as CD57, the lack of CD28 and the re-emergence of CD45RA expression, do not translate into mice."
"Telomere length is also commonly assessed in humans as an indicator of cellular age and replicative senescence, sometimes by flow cytometric methods, but this approach is limited in mice as telomeres are relatively long, meaning that telomere erosion may not be a major driver of immune ageing [757]."
"However, senescent T cells in mice do exhibit increased expression of NK cell related markers, such as KLRG1, and the loss of CD27, allowing us to robustly separate memory subsets and more terminally differentiated populations in mice (Fig."
93).
"Senescent T cells in mice and humans both exhibit an increase in phosphorylated γH2Ax subunits in the cytosol as an indicator of increased ATM kinase activity, increased DNA damage, and a DNA-damage senescence phenotype [739, 763].Open in a separate windowFigure 93.Gating strategy used to define naïve, memory and TTDE CD8 T cell subsets in aged chronically infected mice (applies also to Figs."

Step-by-step sample preparation 1.5.3.1.
Sample collection and RBC lysis Collect a defined volume of blood (up to 75 μL) using a heparinized hematocrit capillary and dispense it into an Eppendorf tube containing 300 μL of HBSS-EDTA buffer.Remove 75 μL for absolute blood cell counting and process as indicated in Section 12.1.3.2.Proceed with the remaining blood in HBSS as indicated below.Centrifuge for 5 min at 700 × g at 4°C.Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 600 μL of distilled water.
"Immediately thereafter (max 5–10 s), add 200 μL of 4× PBS and briefly mix by pulse vortexing.Centrifuge for 5 min at 700 × g at 4°C.Aspirate most of the supernatant (leave approximately 100 μL), resuspend cells in the remaining volume and transfer into a 96-well plate.Centrifuge for 3 min at 700 × g at 4°C.Flick off the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 150 μL of distilled water using a multichannel pipette."
"Immediately thereafter (max 5–10 s), add 50 μL of 4× PBS with a multichannel pipette and mix thoroughly by pipetting."
Discard tips between rows to avoid carryover cell contaminations.Centrifuge for 3 min at 700 × g at 4°CFlick off supernatant and proceed with antibody staining as described in previous chapters (see Chapter IV Section 2.5.
Erythrocyte lysis).1.5.3.2.
Absolute cell counts Lymphocyte counts per volume of blood can be obtained using automated hematology analyzers according to manufacturer's guidelines.
"For measurements using VETSCAN HM5 (Abaxis), a minimum of 75 μL of HBSS-EDTA diluted blood (see 12.1.2.1) is transferred to an Eppendorf tube and acquired."
"Absolute values are calculated in relation to the volume of blood and HBSS-EDTA:Cr=Co(VT/VB),where Cr is the real count of blood cells, Co is the count observed in the analyzer, VB is the volume of the blood in the acquired sample, and VT is the total volume of the blood with HBSS-EDTA at the time of acquisition."
"Alternatively, absolute number of cells in a stained sample can be determined using FCM counting beads (e.g., Precision Count Beads, BioLegend) according to manufacturer's protocol.1.5.4."

Data analysis 1.5.5.1.
"Identification of T cell subsets in aged, uninfected mice Naïve aged mice that are held in a Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) facility will have had limited antigenic exposure."
"Using the classical markers, CD44 and CD62L, for defining naïve and memory subsets in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue, naïve mice exhibit a clear shift with age in T cell subset frequencies, with a decrease in the naïve subset and an increase in memory subsets."
"Of note, this shift in frequency with age is driven by a marked decrease in naïve T cell numbers, particularly CD8 T cells, while memory cell numbers increase more modestly, consistent with their limited antigenic exposure.As described previously (See Chapter VI Section 1.1 Murine T cells), TN cells are CD44−CD62L+ and TEM (and TEFF) cells are CD44hiCD62L− cells but, for CD8 T cells, the CD44hiCD62L+ population contains both TCM and virtual memory (TVM) cells (Fig."
92 and Table 19).
"Cells must be stained with CD49d to differentiate between TCM and TVM cells, with CD49dhi denoting antigen-experienced TCM cells and CD49dlo denoting antigen-inexperienced but cytokine-exposed TVM cells."
This distinction becomes important in ageing research as the proportion of CD8 T cells that are TVM cells increases markedly with age (Table 19) and these cells have been misclassified in the past as TCM cells [738].
"In addition, TVM cells express high levels of CD122 and NK cell markers, both of which increase with age and would otherwise be misattributed to TCM cells [739, 764]."
"An additional feature of aging in mice is that the expression level of CD44 on TN cells increases, not to become CD44hi, but TN cells become predominantly CD44int (Fig."
92).
"This may indicate that the average post-thymic age of aged TN cells is increased or that aged TN cells are exposed to the inflamed aged environment, which is driving modest activation and increased CD44 expression.Table 19.Summary table of aged CD8 T cell subpopulations in naïve micePercentage of CD8 T cellsSubset of CD8 T cellsPhenotypeIn young miceIn aged miceNaiveCD44lo CD62L+ (CD49dlo/int)70–85%30–40%Virtual memory, TVMCD44hi CD62L+ CD49dlo10–15%20–40%Central memory, TCMCD44hi CD62L+ CD49dhi  5–10%10–15%Effector memory, TEM (and effector, TEFF)CD44hi CD62Llo (CD49dhi)  2–5%20–30%Open in a separate window1.5.5.2."
"Identification of T cell subsets in aged chronically infected mice Upon infection, particularly infection with persistent pathogens, T cell populations progress more rapidly toward an aged phenotype, with more terminally differentiated subsets and increased expression of senescence markers (Fig."
95 and reference [758]).
"Therefore, a shorthand for the progression of immune aging phenotypes is given by the frequency and absolute counts of KLRG1+CD27− Terminally Differentiated Effector T cells (TTDE)."
"A common strategy to define naïve cells is to combine CD44 and CD62L staining, where CD44− CD62L+ cells are considered naïve."
"Some commonly used mouse strains (e.g., BALB/c) show a poor separation of naïve from memory cells based on the CD44 marker so an improved separation of naïve CD8 T cells may be achieved by combining CD44 and CD11a labeling, where CD44−CD11alo correspond to naïve cells, although neither of these markers alone robustly separates naïve from primed cells (Fig."
93).
"In addition, CD122, which is expressed on TVM and TCM cells, but not on TN cells, can be used in combination with CD62L to more efficiently separate naïve cells from other subsets (Fig."

"Namely, lowered percentages, but not absolute counts of naïve cells may also be observed due to expansions of TTDE population in persistent herpes viral infections [758], but this does not impair immune protection against infections [765]."
"In conclusion, a combination of six markers (CD11a, CD44, CD27, KLRG1, CD62L, and CD122) allows the distinction between TN, TCM/TVM, TEM, and TTDE T cell populations in chronically infected mice (Table 20), with a robust identification of age-related losses of naïve cell populations and increases in terminally differentiated CD8 T cells, matching functional changes in aging humans.Table 20.Summary table of aged CD8 T cell subpopulations in chronically infected miceSubset of CD8 T cellsPhenotypeNaiveCD11alo CD44lo CD27+ KLRG1− CD62L+ CD122−Central memory, TCM, and virtual memory, TVMCD11ahi CD44hi CD27+ KLRG1− CD62L+ CD122+Effector memory, TEMCD11ahi CD44hi CD27+ KLRG1− CD62L− CD122−/loTerminally Differentiated Effector, TTDECD11ahi CD44hi CD27− KLRG1+ CD62L− CD122−Open in a separate window1.5.6."
"Pitfalls and Top Tricks When working with aged mouse models, consider that mice will be housed in SPF conditions, which is quite different to humans, where pathogen exposure accumulates over the lifespan.Aged mice can accumulate age-related abnormalities, such as tumors, or they can overgroom, which can lead to skin abrasions and infections."
"This can lead to immune activation in aged mice, so many researchers exclude mice with overt abnormalities from analyses.TVM cells are selectively retained with increasing age and are often misidentified as TCM cells."
"Including CD49d in staining panels enables identification of TCM cells as distinct from TVM cells.Aged leukocytes can be more sensitive to physical manipulation, especially RBC lysis, so make sure to time this reaction carefully.1.5.7."

Murine Foxp3+ regulatory T cells1.6.1.
"Overview Tregs are a subset of CD4+ T cells that have fundamental functions in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and peripheral tolerance, among others."
"Treg cells can be found in almost any tissue including primary lymphoid organs (thymus, bone marrow), secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches) as well as various non-lymphoid tissues (e.g."
"intestine, skin, lung, liver, fat)."
"Importantly, the Treg cell population is extremely heterogeneous and consists of numerous, highly specialized subsets that vary tremendously between the different organs and tissues."
"In this section, guidelines for widely accepted FCM-based phenotyping strategies for murine Treg cells in both lymphoid organs and selected non-lymphoid tissues will be provided, and particular emphasis will be laid on markers for the identification of Treg cell subsets.1.6.2."
"Introduction Treg cells were originally described as CD4+ suppressor T cells constitutively expressing CD25, the α-chain of the IL-2 receptor complex [766]."
"Yet, precise identification of Treg cells by CD25 expression turned out to be difficult as CD25 is also induced on many effector T cell subsets upon activation."
"Thus, the discovery of the transcription factor Forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) as the lineage-defining factor for Treg cells was a breakthrough in Treg cell-based research [767, 768]."
"Importantly, Foxp3 does not only serve as a marker for the more precise identification of Treg cells, but it was also shown to support Treg cell function [767, 768] through the maintenance of Treg-cell-specific gene expression signatures [769]."
"The physiological importance of Foxp3 can be further emphasized by mutations in the Foxp3 gene, resulting in the development of fatal autoimmune diseases like the lymphoproliferative scurfy phenotype in mice or the IPEX-syndrome (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked inheritance) in humans [770–772].The Foxp3+ Treg cell population can be roughly categorized into two subpopulations based on the site of their development: Some Foxp3+ Treg cells are already generated within the thymus and thus named thymus-derived Treg cells (tTreg cells) [773]."
"These tTreg cells are complemented by peripherally induced Treg cells (pTreg cells), which convert from naïve Foxp3− CD4+ T cells preferentially at mucosal sites [774]."
"A number of proteins like Helios, Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1), or RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (RORγt) were suggested to distinguish between tTreg and pTreg cells [775–778], yet their usability particularly under inflammatory conditions has been questioned [779–781]."
"Importantly, accumulating evidence suggests that the Foxp3+ Treg cell population is not homogeneous and that co-expression of additional transcription factors, such as T- box transcription factor TBX21 (T-bet), GATA binding protein 3 (Gata-3), RORγt, or IFN regulatory factor 4 (Irf4), is required for the acquisition of unique functional properties within highly specialized Treg cell subsets [782]."
"The frequency of murine Foxp3+ Treg cells in both lymphoid organs and non-lymphoid tissues fluctuates considerably between individual mice and is influenced by multiple factors including genetic background, age, gender, microbiota composition, nutrition, inflammation, and infection.1.6.3."
Treg cells in murine lymphoid organs 1.6.3.1.
"Treg cells in the murine thymus After CD4 lineage decision, some CD4 single-positive (SP) thymocytes, upon TCR stimulation, can develop into CD25+Foxp3+ tTreg cells through two distinct developmental programs involving CD25+Foxp3− and CD25−Foxp3+ Treg cell precursors (Fig."
96) [773].
Recent data suggest that the two distinct developmental programs are both required for the generation of a comprehensive Treg cell repertoire [783].
CD25+Foxp3+ tTreg cells can be further subdivided into subsets with different maturity based on CD69 and also CD24 expression (Fig.
"96), which is known to correlate inversely to the maturity of CD4SP and CD8SP thymocytes [784].Open in a separate windowFigure 96.Phenotyping of Treg cells from the murine thymus."
Gating strategy to identify Treg cells in the thymus.
"From all events, lymphocytes can be distinguished by their FSC/SSC properties (gate G0)."
"After lymphocyte gating, doublets are excluded twice (gates G1 and G2), followed by exclusion of dead or autofluorescent cells (gate G3)."
"From G3, CD4SP thymocytes (gate G4) are gated, from which two Treg cell precursors (G5 and G6) and thymic Treg cells (G7) can be identified."
Thymic Treg cells (G7) and CD4SP thymocytes (G4) can be subdivided into two subsets of CD24highCD69+ immature (G8 and G10) and C D24dim/low C D69− (G9 and G11) mature cells.

"On the one hand, CD4SP gating needs to be strict; otherwise, contamination from CD4−CD8− double-negative (DN) cells could substantially increase the frequency of CD25+Foxp3− Treg cell precursors."
"Yet, the CD25 expression level within DN thymocytes is much higher than within CD25+Foxp3− Treg precursors."
"On the other hand, Treg cells have lower CD4 expression compared to their CD4+Foxp3− Tcon counterpart."
"Thus, too strict gating can negatively influence the frequency of Treg cells among CD4SP cells (Figure 96).Mediastinal lymph nodes are located in proximity to the thymus and can swell under inflammatory conditions."
"When removing thymi from mice with local inflammation, particular caution has to be paid to avoid “contamination” of the thymus material with mediastinal lymph nodes.Top tricks: Isolation and analysis of Treg cells from thymusA substantial portion of Treg cells found within the thymus are Treg cells recirculating from the periphery [785]."
"These recirculating cells can be identified as CCR6+CCR7− cells [786], or more easily when using RAGGFP reporter mice."
"Only recently developed tTreg cells are RAGGFP positive, while recirculating Treg cells are RAGGFP negative.Not only αβ+ T cells but also γδ+ T cells and NKT cells develop within the thymus."
An extra dump panel for NK1.1+ and TCRγ/δ+ cells results in higher specificity.Thymi will shrink upon aging.
6–10 weeks mice are most commonly used to study thymocytes.
Younger or older mice may result in lower numbers of Treg cells for analysis or sorting.Sacrificing mice with cervical dislocation can result in bleeding into the thoracic cavity.

"Treg cells in murine spleen and lymph nodes The frequency of murine Foxp3+ Treg cells among CD4+ T cells usually ranges from 10% to 20% in secondary lymphoid organs such as spleen, skin-draining lymph nodes, and mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig."
97).
"The Treg cell population in any secondary lymphoid organ is a mixture of tTreg and pTreg cells, and Helios staining is most frequently used to discriminate tTreg (Foxp3+Helios+) and pTreg (Foxp3+Helios−) cells (Fig."

Taking out fat instead of lymph nodes is one common mistake.
"Thus, for practicing it is easier to use young mice with lower body fat content.Erythrocyte lysis of spleen samples before staining is mandatory to avoid high background staining or clogging of the cytometer.Top tricks: Isolation and analysis of Treg cells from spleen and lymph nodesInspect collected lymph nodes in FCM buffer before dissociating them."
"Lymph nodes should sink, while fat pads float.Besides Helios, Nrp-1 is a commonly used maker to distinguish tTreg and pTreg cells."
"As Helios− Nrp-1− Treg cells in mesenteric lymph nodes are mainly RORγt+, this marker was also claimed as a good tool to identify pTreg cells within the intestinal system.For the sorting of intact Foxp3+ Treg cells for the collection of RNA, various Foxp3 reporter mouse lines can be used to avoid the fixation and permeabilization during the intracellular staining.Stimulation of CD4+ T cells before staining will result in downregulation of CD3ε and CD4, which could complicate the gating (Fig."

"Treg cells in murine non-lymphoid tissues Apart from their fundamental immune regulatory function, Treg cells perform highly specialized functions in non-lymphoid tissues [787]."
"They have been shown to support tissue homeostasis and regeneration, ranging from regulating metabolic parameters in the adipose tissue [788–790] to potentiating tissue repair, e.g."
in skeletal muscles [791] or lung tissue [792].
"In addition, Treg cells in nonlymphoid tissues can manipulate tissue precursor cells to maintain tissue homeostasis."
"For example, Treg cells can promote oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and, thereby, myelin regeneration in the central nervous system [793]."
"In the skin, Treg cells promote hair follicle regeneration by augmenting hair follicle stem cell proliferation and differentiation [794]."
"Several publications identified the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand amphiregulin as a key factor of tissue Treg cells to maintain homeostasis or induce tissue regeneration in a diverse set of tissues, including lung, muscle, and brain [791, 792]."
"All data show that these noncanonical Treg cell functions to directly or indirectly promote organ homeostasis and tissue repair warrant a new definition of Treg cells: Treg cells are not only regulatory as their historic name implies, but subpopulations of Treg cells residing in non-lymphoid tissues are tissue-supporting and have ability to promote tissue regeneration."
"Recently, Treg cells residing in nonlymphoid tissues were studied on an epigenetic and transcriptional level, and a subset of Treg cells expressing the marker KLRG1 and the IL-33 receptor ST2 was identified [795]."
This subset of tissue-resident Treg cells expressing ST2 was termed tisTregST2.
"This population can be found in every organ and tissue analyzed so far, vigorously increases in number upon IL-33 treatment in vivo, and is dependent on the transcription factor Batf [795, 796]."
"TisTregST2 cells are strongly Th2-like biased (among others, high expression of Gata-3) compared to other Treg cell populations or Tcon cells found in the same tissue, and express the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand amphiregulin in high amounts [795].In the following, we describe the isolation and characterization of these tisTregST2 cells from different murine organs, including liver, skin, adipose tissue, lung, and colon.1.6.4.1."

"From all events, a CD4-gate to identify T cells can be drawn (gate G0)."
"In the plot, the smaller color-coded plots indicate expression of CD3ε in the same SSC-A vs CD4 plot."
Presence of CD3ε+ cells in the G0 gate can be appreciated.
"Based on G0, lymphocytes can be identified by their FSC/SSC properties (gate G1)."
"Next, doublets are excluded (gate G2) as well as unwanted, dead or autofluorescent cells (gate G3)."
"From G3, CD4+CD3ε+ T cells (gate G4) are gated, from which Treg cells (gate G6) and Tcon cells (gate G5) can be identified."
"Finally, Klrg1+ST2+ tisTregST2 (gate G7) are gated from Treg cells (gate G6)."
"A staining of Gata-3, shown in the histogram, exemplifies the expression of this marker in liver Tcon cells (gate G5, orange, dotted line), liver Klrg1+ST2+ tisTregST2 cells (gate G7, red), and liver Klrg1−ST2− Treg cells (gate G8, blue)."
"In (D), the same gating strategy as described for liver is applied to a spleen sample."
"In both tissues, CD4+Foxp3+Klrg1+ST2+Gata-3high tisTregST2 cells can be identified with the proposed gating strategy."
CD3ε or TCRβ antibodies can be used.

"It is helpful to turn off the electric force in the pipet aid to slowly release the 80% Percoll-PBS.Centrifuge for 20 min with 2000 × g at 4°C, acceleration off, deceleration off."
"If successful, hepatocytes will float on top of gradient and can be removed via aspiration."
"The middle phase contains immune cells and should be collected in a separate tube, while the pellet contains RBCs and other cell types and can be discarded (Fig."
98B).Dilute middle phase with PBS to a volume of 50 mL.Centrifuge for 5 min with 300 × g at 4°C.
"Cellular pellet contains lymphocyte fraction and, following RBC lysis, can be used for immediate analysis or sorting.Materials: See 1.6.5: Isolation and analysis of Treg cells from murine non-lymphoid organsPitfalls: Isolation and analysis of Treg cells from liverIncomplete perfusion of the animal will result in RBC contamination."
Fast experimental protocols and fast animal handling are required.
Do not forget to open the vena cava prior to flushing the circulation with PBS.Poor recovery after mashing step with large livers: add more digestion buffer to completely wash filter mesh.
Do not use medium or PBS to wash filter mash since collagenase levels will be diluted.Gradient setup fails and poor lymphocyte recovery after gradient centrifugation: Slowly add 80% Percoll to solution and use a pipetting aid without acceleration/deceleration to avoid mixing 40% and 80% solutions.
Handle tubes carefully to avoid mixing both phases.
"Carefully balance the centrifuge to avoid imbalance or rotor damage.Low CD4+ T cell content (100 day old animal contains not more than 5000–10 000 Foxp3+ Treg cells when applying the proposed method, and Foxp3+ Treg cell frequency of CD4+ T cells is usually above 40%.GentleMACS® mechanical failure or tube squeaking sounds: Cut skin into very small pieces using sharp scissors."
"When using thick skin patches or large (>2 g) amounts of skin, recut skin tissues during incubation on the GentleMACS® machine."
Use more skin digestion buffer or distribute skin among more C tubes if required.Being unable to find lymphocytes: It is sometimes tricky to identify lymphocytes during flow cytometric analysis of skin.
Use gating strategy provided in Fig.

"If in doubt, use additional T-cell markers (other than CD4) to clearly identify the T-cell population, such as TCR-β, CD45, or CD90."
Be aware that CD4 staining is weak if you use the protocol described above.
It is helpful to use an autofluorescence-free channel with high staining index (such as PE or APC) for CD4 staining.Poor sort purity or contamination with skin keratinocytes after sorting: Use a double-sort approach (yield and four-way-purity) to avoid contaminating sample with skin-resident cells.
See top tricks for more details.Machine clogging or no events: Wash machine and filter sample again and re-acquire.
Keep sample cool at 4°C and continuous rotation (300 rpm).Top tricks: Isolation and analysis of Treg cells from skinWe were unable to perform pre-enrichment using magnetic beads for murine skin-based samples.
"Still, because of the very low frequency of Foxp3+ Treg cells as well as the high viscosity of the resulting cell mixture in murine skin samples, enrichment would be beneficial to decrease sorting and measurement time.Sorting bulk skin Treg cells can lead to poor recovery of cells (low “sort efficiency”) and, based on the parameters of the sorting instrument, also to contamination with skin keratinocytes (aggregates with immune cells)."
"Therefore, we propose a two- step sorting protocol: first, a pre-enrich sort (sort strategy: “yield”) where target cells are sorted into FCM buffer."
"Second, the sample is re-acquired and sorted again with high purity (sort strategy: “purity” or “4-way-purity”)."
"Using this strategy, skin samples can be sorted at high speed without losing many target cells.For flow cytometric analysis, samples should be filtered again immediately before acquisition."
"If acquisition takes more than 5 min, the sample should be filtered again to avoid a clogging of the instrument."
Samples should be cooled at 4°C to avoid clogging.Fixing samples will generally increase the sample flow through cytometers.
Be careful when setting your FCS/SSC voltages to include your target cells.

The population in gate G7 (tisTregST2: CD8−CD19−MHCII−CD4+TCRβ+CD25+Foxp3+Klrg1+ST2+Gata-3+) comprises less than 2% of all Treg cells found in lymphatic organs.
"Non-lymphoid tissues showed a clear enrichment for the tisTregST2 population, with organ to organ variation (liver: 26.4%, skin: 95.3%, abdominal/epididymal fat: 48.4%, lung: 11.5%, colon: 17.2% of all Foxp3+ Treg cells isolated from the individual tissues) (Figs."

The frequency and number of tisTregST2 cells is dependent on the age of the analyzed animals.
"For example, the frequency of tisTregST2 cells in abdominal/epididymal fat tissue can vary depending on the age of the animals, with older animals showing higher frequencies."
"In 20–30 weeks old male mice, the frequency of tisTregST2 cells among all Treg cells isolated from the abdominal/epididymal fat depot can be up to 95%.1.6.5."

Murine γδ T cells1.7.1.
"OverviewIn this section, we discuss the specific requirements to analyze γδ T cells by FCM."
"This includes general recommendations, an overview of the specific tools available to study γδ T cells by FCM, a detailed protocol to stain for a specific subset of γδ T cells, and a point-by-point protocol to isolate and analyze γδ T cells from mouse ear skin."
Protocols to isolate γδ T cells (and αβ T cells) from the mouse intestine are given in a subsequent related section.1.7.2.
Introductionγδ T cells develop in the thymus together with αβ T cells but rearrange a different T-cell receptor (TCR) consisting of a TCR-γ and TCR-δ chain (see also Chapter VI Section 1.15 Human γδ T cells).
"These TCRγδ are not MHC restricted, thus their antigen recognition does not rely on CD4 or CD8 coreceptors, although the majority of mouse intestinal intraepithelial γδ T lymphocytes (γδ iIELs) express the CD8αα dimer."
"Mouse γδ T-cells comprise significantly different populations, and these γδ T-cell subsets are typically grouped by the variable γ-chain (Vγ) segments employed by their TCRγδ [797]."
"Alternatively, γδ T-cell subsets may also be grouped according to γδ T-cell tissue location or with respect to γδ T-cell function [798, 799].1.7.3. γδ T cells in peripheral lymph nodesFCM of γδ T cells is technically not different to FCM of αβ T cells."
"However, γδ T cells are up to 100-fold less frequent than αβ T cells in blood and secondary lymphoid organs and therefore their detection faces the usual challenges connected to identifying rare cell types, i.e., make sure to include all real γδ T cells but avoid false positive events due to autofluorescence and unspecific staining."
"On the other hand, γδ T cells can make up the majority of lymphocytes in tissues such as the skin and the small intestinal epithelium.1.7.3.1."
Step-by-step sample preparation A dedicated step-bystep sample preparation protocol to obtain single cell suspensions from peripheral lymphoid organs is described in the murine Treg section (Chapter VI Section 1.6 Murine Foxp3+regulatory T cells).
"Briefly, lymph nodes are collected and mashed through a cell strainer or similar and filtered through or a piece of gaze (pore size 70–100 μm) before adding FcBlock and staining with specific mAbs.1.7.3.2."
Materials/ Specific tools for FCM of γδ T cells There are a number of mAb clones available for detection of γδ TCR using specific Vγ and Vδ segments.
Below is a list of commercially available mAb clones (Table 21).
"However, be aware that several conflicting nomenclatures exist for mouse (and human) Vγ and Vδ segments, which can be misleading even for insiders to the field."
Please check online resources such as the IMGT website (http://www.imgt.org) for further explanation.

"Later, Christina Roark and colleagues found that 17D1 was cross-reactive to Vγ6 under certain conditions, see below [804].1.7.3.3."
"Data analysis Practically, faithful detection of γδ T cells is warranted by gating on the lymphocyte area in the FSA versus SSA plot, gating out doublets, exclusion of dead and autofluorescent cells, followed by a positive gate according to the two parameters expression of γδ TCR, best clone is GL3 [805] and CD3ε in the same plot (Fig."

"Note that for visualizing γδ T cells in secondary lymphoid organs or other tissues containing a large excess of αβ T cells over γδ T cells in microscopy applications, the use of F1 heterozygotes from Tcrd-H2BEGFP mice and Tcra−/− (B6.129S2-Tcratm1Mom/J, JAX Stock No."

Intracellular cytokine staining for IL-17-versus IFN-γ-producing γδ T cells1.7.4.1.
"Introduction Recent studies suggested that discrete subsets of γδ T cells; namely IFN-γ- and IL-17-producing γδ T cells, develop and act as pre-activated effector cells."
"In particular, a combination of the the surface markers CD27, CD44, and Ly6C can be used to indirectly discriminate between those subsets without intracellular cytokine staining [809–811].1.7.4.2."
"Step-by-step sample preparation For Intracellular cytokine staining, isolated cells are first stimulated ex vivo with PMA (50 ng/mL, Calbiochem) and Iono (2 μg/mL, Invitrogen) together with Brefeldin A (1 μg/mL, Sigma) for 3 h at 37°C., Next, stimulated cells are stained against extracellular surface molecules."
"After fixation with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution for 20 min on ice and permeabilization with BD Perm/Wash buffer for 10 min on ice according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit), cells are stained for intracellular cytokines for 45 min on ice, washed once with PBS, and analyzed.1.7.4.3."
"Data analysis Surface staining against CD27, CD44, and Ly6C serves to discriminate activated γδ T cells with an IL-17-producing effector phenotype (CD44high+CD27−) or with an IFN-γ-producing effector phenotype (CD44high/intCD27+) (Fig."

Isolation of lymphocytes from mouse ear skin1.7.5.1.
"Introduction The skin as well as several mucosal tissues such as the intestine harbor strong and thick walls on their surface, which are composed of different layers."
"Hence, isolation of lymphocytes from these tissues warrants elaborated protocols."
"The skin consists of two primary layers, the keratinized epidermis on the surface and the beneath dermis."
"In mice, lymphocytes of both, epidermal and dermal layers, can be preferably isolated from ear skin according to the following protocol (Figure 105).Open in a separate windowFigure 105.Preparation of ear skin."

Data analysis The skin harbors a high amount of lymphocytes.
"While αβ T cells are barely present in the mouse skin, the vast majority of lymphocytes are γδ T cells."
"γδ T cells localized in the epidermis (dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC)) can be easily distinguished from γδ T cells present in the dermis due to their high TCR expression levels as detected by GL3 and CD3 staining in (Figure 106).Open in a separate windowFigure 106.Representative gating strategy of murine ear skin lymphocytes stained with DAPI, anti-CD45, TCRαβ (H57), γδ TCR (GL3), and CD3 to detect dermal γδ T cells (CD3+ and GL3+) and epidermal γδ T cells (DETC, CD3hi, and GL3hi).1.7.6."
The auxiliary Ab-assisted direct staining of Vγ6+ γδ T cells1.7.6.1.
"Introduction Vγ6+ γδ T cells solely develop in embryonic thymus before birth, and later persist as long-lived self-renewing lymphocytes in the skin dermis and in many mucosal tissues such as the uterus or the tongue [812]."
"Vγ6+ γδ T cells recently sparked a lot of interest because they rapidly produce IL-17 and thus contribute to bacterial homeostasis and clearance, but also enhance autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases [813, 814]."
The detection of Vγ6+ γδ T cells requires a combined staining of GL3 together with the unconjugated rabbit 17D1 IgM Ab followed by a secondary staining with labeled anti-rabbit IgM.
A validated staining protocol for the identification of Vγ6+ γδ T cells works as follows:1.7.6.2.
"Step-by-step sample preparation and Materials Prepare single cell suspensionBlock cells with 5% Fc receptor block5 min on iceStain cells in antibody mix with extracellular surface markers and GL3 diluted in PBS containing 3% FCS and 4mM EDTA, hre called FCM buffer15 min on iceAdd unconjugated 17D1 (final dilution 1:25) and mix thoroughly (for example: add 4μl of 17D1 to 100μl cell suspension)30 min on iceWash cells with flow cytometry bufferStain cells with labeled secondary anti-IgM Antibodydiluted in FCM buffer30 min on iceWash cells with flow cytometry bufferOpen in a separate window1.7.6.3."
"Data analysis Importantly, in skin, clone17D1 not only stains Vγ6+ γδ T cells in combination with GL3, but also recognizes the Vγ5 gene segment expressed in dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC)."
"However, dermal Vγ6+ γδ T cells and epidermal Vγ5+ γδ T cells can be easily distinguished because of the very high TCR levels levels in Vγ5+ γδ T cells leading to bright GL3 and CD3 staining."
"The epidermis solely contains Vγ5+ γδ T cells, while the dermal compartment comprises high frequencies of Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ γδ T cells (Fig."
"107).Open in a separate windowFigure 107.Representative gating strategies of Vγ4+ (red) and Vγ6+ (green) γδ T cells in peripheral lymph nodes (pLN) (A) as well as epidermal Vγ5+ γδ T cells (red) and dermal Vγ4+ and Vγ6+ γδ T cells (blue) in ear skin (B) GL3+CD3+ γδ T cells among TCRß− cells were separated into different γδ subsets by staining with anti-Vγ4 as well as 17D1 followed by conjugated anti-IgM to detect Vγ6+/Vγ5+ γδ T cells.It follows that an additional counterstaining of 17D1+ skin T cells with a specific anti-Vγ5 mAb clone 536, see Table 21, would further help to discriminate between dermal and and TCRhigh epidermal T cells (Fig."
107B and not shown).
"In contrast, peripheral lymph nodes lack Vγ5+ γδ T cells."
"While Vγ6+ γδ T cells only represent a small population in peripheral lymph nodes, a large proportion of γδ T cells are Vγ4+ γδ T cells and Vγ6−Vγ4− γδ T cells (mainly Vγ1+ T cells).1.8."
Murine NKT cells1.8.1.
"OverviewMurine natural killer T (NKT) cells were originally defined by their co-expression of surface markers characteristic for T cells (i.e., the TCR) and NK cells (e.g., NK1.1 in C57BL/6 mice) [815, 816]."
"This chapter focuses on the phenotypic characterization of so-called murine invariant iNKT cells, which express an invariant Vα14Jα18 TCRα chain and a limited set of TCRβ chains with a preference for Vβ8, Vβ7, and Vβ2 [817, 818]."
"iNKT cells recognize lipids, such as α-galactosyl ceramide (αGalCer), in the context of the nonclassical MHC molecule CD1d [819]."
"As a consequence, iNKT cells can be unambiguously identified by surface staining using CD1d tetramers loaded with αGalCer or its derivatives, such as PBS-57 [820, 821] (Fig."

Numbers adjacent to gates indicate frequency of parent population.1.8.2.
IntroductionDevelopment of iNKT cells diverges at the CD4+CD8+ double-positive stage of T-cell development.
Selection of iNK T cells is mediated by cortical thymocytes rather than epithelial cells.
"Similar to other unconventional T cells, iNKT cells are selected by strong TCR signals in a process referred to as agonist selection [822]."
"iNKT cells, with the notable exception of some tissue-resident subsets, express and are dependent on the prototypical transcription factor for innate-like T cells, PLZF (encoded by Zbtb16) [823, 824]."
"Intrathymic development of iNKT cells has originally been described to progress through four phenotypically distinct stages (stage 0–3), characterized by differential expression of the surface markers CD24, CD44, and NK1.1 (in C57BL/6 mice) as well as cell size [825–827] (Fig."
109A).
"More recent studies showed that stage 3 iNKT cells represent long-term resident cells in the thymus [828, 829]."
"The thymus of young adult C57BL/6 mice contains around 3–6 × 105 iNKT cells, corresponding to an overall frequency of 0.3–0.5% of all thymocytes.Open in a separate windowFigure 109.Murine thymic iNKT cell populations."

109B).
"Like their conventional T-cell counterparts, NKT1 cells are characterized by expression of the transcription factor T-bet, NKT17 cells express RORγt, whereas NKT2 cells are most frequently characterized by absence of expression of both transcription factors while simultaneously expressing very high levels of PLZF (See Chapter VI Section 1.1 Murine T cells)."
The prototypic type 2 transcription factor GATA-3 is variably expressed in all iNKT cells and cannot be employed for discrimination of NKT2 cells.
"As a consequence, in the thymus PLZFhi NKT cells contain both, precursors (NKTp) and NKT2 cells."
These cells can be further distinguished by differential expression of CCR7 (NKTp) and PD-1 (NKT2) [828].
"Notably, relative proportions of the three NKT subsets vary widely between mouse strains with BALB/c mice showing a strong bias towards NKT2 cells in the thymus, whereas thymi in C57BL/6 mice predominantly contain NKT1 cells [830]."
"To circumvent intracellular staining for transcription factors, discrimination of NKT-cell subsets can also be achieved by analysis of surface expression of CD4 and CD122 (thymus) (Fig."

"Boldface 1, 2, and 17 adjacent to gates indicate NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17 subsets, respectively.Outside the thymus, iNKT cells can be found in lymphoid and as tissue-resident cells in non-lymphoid organs with distinct subset composition for each organ (for review [831, 832])."
"In mice (but not humans) up to 40% of all mononuclear cells in liver constitute iNKT cells [815, 821]."
The vast majority of these cells are of the NKT1 type.
"Upon stimulation iNKT cells rapidly produce large amounts of cytokines essentially according to their transcription factor profile with the notable exception of IL-4, which can be produced by NKT1 and NKT2 cells."
"Similar to other unconventional T cells, iNKT cells are considered innate-like, because they can be stimulated both by cognate ligand via the TCR and in a non-cognate manner through LPS or cytokines like IL-12 and IL-18 [833, 834]."
"Whereas stimulation through the TCR results in rapid release of multiple cytokines, non-cognate stimulation results mostly in production of IFN-γ.NKT cells serve a vast variety of functions shaped by their distinct tissue distribution (reviewed in ref."
"[831, 835]."
"Thus, NKT cells may protect from infection in lung and liver, but may exacerbate inflammatory conditions and asthma."
"Although being comparatively rare in intestinal tissues, NKT cells contribute to tissue homeostasis and to shaping the intestinal microbiota."
Other roles in tissue homeostasis comprise regulation of T-cell development and egress from the thymus through IL-4 as well as protective functions in type 1 diabetes and graft-versus-host disease [836].1.8.3.

Cells are washed once in FCM buffer followed by Ab staining for surface markers for 10 min at 4°C.

PitfallsSimultaneous staining of cells with tetramer and anti-TCRβ is possible.
"However, due to distinct staining conditions, it may result in different staining intensities."
CD24 Ab staining is sensitive to EDTA.
Distribution of iNKT cell subsets varies between organs and also between mouse strains.
"For instance, in liver iNKT1 cells constitute the predominant iNKT cell subset, whereas mesenteric lymph nodes predominantly contain iNKT2 cells [839]."
"Furthermore, BALB/c mice display a strong bias towards iNKT2 cells when compared to C57BL/6 mice [830].1.8.6."
Top tricksiNKT cells are a rare population of T cells.
"Therefore, for some downstream analyses it is advisable to perform enrichment using magnetic beads (see also Chapter IV Section 1.4 Magnetic pre-enrichment for high-resolution detection and analysis of rare cell populations)."
"We and others have found that differences in frequencies of iNKT cells in mouse strains with iNKT cell deficiency, such as miR-181a/b-1-deficient mice, compared to wild-type mice are essentially retained upon enrichment via tetramers [840]."
The underlying reason remains elusive but may be attributed to lower affinity of tetramers when compared to Ab–antigen interaction.
We and others have employed Rag-GFP reporter mice to delineate developmental progression of iNKT cells in the thymus.
"Such a mouse model may help to further resolve NKT cell precursors and mature NKT cell populations in the thymus [828, 841].1.8.7."

Murine mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells1.9.1.
OverviewMurine mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) share many features with iNKT cells.
"They express a semi-invariant TCR comprised of an invariant Vα19Jα33 TCRα chain, preferentially paired with Vβ6 and Vβ8."
"MAIT cells recognize vitamin B metabolites, such as 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribityl-aminouracil (5-OP-RU), in the context of the nonclassical MHC molecule MHC class I-related protein 1 (MR1) [842]."
"Despite their virtually simultaneous discovery with NKT cells, understanding of MAIT cell biology is substantially more limited for two main reasons [843, 844]: (i) MAIT cells are rare in mice and (ii) MR1-tetramer reagents have only recently been developed [845, 846] (Fig."
111).
"This section describes the characterization of MAIT cell subsets based on MR1-tetramers, surface markers, and key transcription factors."
"In addition, magnetic-bead based enrichment of MAIT cells is described.Open in a separate windowFigure 111.A) Basic gating strategy for thymic MAIT cells."
B) Basic gating strategy for thymic MAIT cells following magnetic-bead enrichment.
Numbers adjacent to gates indicate frequency of parent population.
Stainings with control tetramer MR1–6-FP-APC are displayed as well.1.9.2.
"IntroductionThe study of MAIT cells in mice is of profound interest, mostly because MAIT cells constitute a very abundant population in various human tissues, comprising almost 10% of all blood T cells and 20–40% of all liver T cells (See also Chapter VI Section 1.17 Human mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells)."
"In contrast, in C57BL/6 mice, thymus contains only around 5000 MAIT cells, corresponding to 0.002% of all thymocytes."
Comparably low frequencies are also found in peripheral lymphoid organs.Intrathymic development of MAIT cells shares some similarities with that of NKT cells: MAIT cells are selected on cortical CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes.
They progress through phenotypically distinct precursor stages (stages 1–3) characterized by differential expression of CD24 and CD44 [847] (Fig.
112A).
"Development of MAIT cells depends on the transcription factor PLZF and miRNA, in particular miR-181a/b-1 [840, 841, 847]."
"These similarities are further underscored by characterization of T-bet+RORγtlo MAIT1 and T-bet−RORγthi MAIT17 cell transcriptomes, which within matching tissues are virtually identical to those of NKT1 and NKT17 cells, respectively [832]."
MAIT cells also display a large degree of tissue residency in non-lymphoid organs [832] (Fig.
112B).
"In addition to these similarities between MAIT cells and iNKT cells, there are a number of critical differences."
"MAIT cell development is characterized by a later onset of PLZF expression at developmental stage 3 only, whereas at least some NKTp already express high levels of PLZF [828, 847]."
"Furthermore, no MAIT2 cells have been described and the ratio between MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells is geared toward the latter, whereas NKT1 cells are more abundant than NKT17 cells."
It remains an open question whether MAIT cells undergo agonist selection in a similar manner as NKT cells.Open in a separate windowFigure 112.Thymic MAIT cell populations.

"Boldface S1, S2, S3 adjacent to gates indicate developmental stages."
"Boldface 1 and 17 adjacent to gates indicate MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets, respectively.Analysis of in vivo function of MAIT cells in immunity is compromised by their scarcity in mice."
"In addition, many Vα19Jα33 TCRα+ T cells in Vα19Jα33 TCR transgenic mice lack expression of PLZF, indicating that they do not represent true MAIT cells [846]."
These obstacles may be overcome by employing B6-MAITCAST congenic mice that contain high frequencies of MAIT cells due to increased usage of Vα19 in TCR gene rearrangements [848].
This mouse model revealed that MAIT cells alleviated urinary tract infections.
MR1-deficient mice are more susceptible to a broad range of bacterial infections (for review see ref.
[849]).
"Given that MAIT cells have also been implicated in clearance of viral infections suggests that antigen-independent stimulation via cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-18, is also possible, in keeping with their innate-like nature and overall similarity to iNKT cells.1.9.3."
Step-by-step sample preparation1.9.3.1.
"Cell isolation Single-cell suspensions of whole lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen, lymph nodes) are generated by crushing organs through a 70-μm filter."
RBCs are lysed (spleen only) using Qiagen RBC Lysis Solution according to manufacturer's instructions.
"For lymphocyte isolation from the lung and liver, mice are euthanized and liver/lungs are immediately perfused with PBS."
Lymphocytes are then isolated using standard procedures for solid organs or using commercially available kits for instance as described in ref.
[837].
It is advisable to pool cell suspensions from at least three animals to obtain sufficient cell numbers for analysis.1.9.3.2.
"Surface staining Following incubation with Fc block (anti-mouse CD16/32, clone 2.4G2) cells are first stained using APC- or PE-conjugated MR1–5-OP-RU or MR1–6-FP (background control) tetramers for 40 min at room temperature in FCM buffer [850]."
Cells are washed once in FCM buffer followed by Ab staining for surface markers for 10 min at 4°C.
"In order to minimize background, it is pivotal to perform lineage exclusion by staining for the following markers: B220, CD19, CD11b, and CD11c."
Dead cells are excluded using the Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Biolegend).1.9.3.3.
Magnetic-bead enrichment Due to the scarcity of murine MAIT cells in typical laboratory strains it is strongly advised to bead-enrich MAIT cells prior to downstream analysis.
Bead enrichment should be performed in between tetramer staining and staining for additional surface markers.
Single-cell suspensions are stained with biotinylated CD19 mAb and anti-B220 Abs.
B cells are then depleted using streptavidin microbeads as per the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec).
"Following MR1–5-OP-RU-APC tetramer staining, MAIT cells are enriched using anti-APC magnetic microbeads following the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec)."

"PitfallsMAIT cells constitute an extremely rare cell population, rendering subset analysis prone to errors based on background staining (see Chapter V Section 1 Rare cells—General rules)."
This difficulty is exacerbated in the analysis of genetically modified mice with developmental defects in the MAIT cell lineage.
"To minimize background, it is pivotal to include lineage markers in a dump channel and/or enrich prior to downstream analysis."
B cells in particular show a high degree of nonspecific binding of the MR1 tetramer (both 5-OP-RU and 6-FP loaded).
Simultaneous staining of cells with tetramer and anti-TCRβ is possible.
"However, due to distinct staining conditions it may result in different staining intensities."
CD24 antibody staining is sensitive to EDTA.1.9.6.
"Top tricksIn order to overcome problems associated with low frequencies of MAIT cells, it is generally recommended to enrich for MR1–5-OP-RU-tet+ cells for subset analysis whenever possible; see also Chapter IV Section 1.4 Magnetic preenrichment for high-resolution detection and analysis of rare cell populations."
"Notably, it has been demonstrated that magnetic-bead-based enrichment via tetramers essentially retains differences between wild-type frequencies and reduced MAIT-cell frequencies observed in genetically modified mice [841, 847]."
"The underlying mechanism remains unclear, but may be related to the relative inefficiency of tetramer-based enrichment, which in turn may be due to lower affinity of tetramer when compared to antibody-mediated binding."
"Furthermore, it is absolutely essential to exclude non-T lineage cells, most notably B cells, during gating to limit background staining."
It is also advisable to include nonbinding MR1–6-FP tetramers as background controls.
"Finally, for exact quantitation of MAIT cells, dual tetramer staining using a combination of MR1–5-OP-RU-APC and PE labeled tetramers may help to reduce background [841]."
We and others have employed Rag-GFP reporter mice to delineate developmental progression of MAIT cells in the thymus.

Murine intestinal intraepithelial T cells1.10.1.
"OverviewIn this section, we describe protocols to isolate and analyze murine intestinal intra-epithelial lymphocytes (iIELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) by FCM."
"In particular, the protocol iIEL isolation and most of the subsequent flow cytometric analysis applies similarly to αβ and γδ iIELs, which are very similar cell types.1.10.2."
IntroductionThe intestinal epithelium constitutes one of the greatest surface barriers in mammals and is in continuous contact with the (gut luminal) environment.
"Composed by a mucosa, the intestine wall is made up of primary two layers, namely a one cell layer epithelium and the underlying lamina propria [851, 852]."
"In addition, the mouse small intestine contains five to seven Peyer's patches in anti-mesenteric position, which are excised and removed during the protocol below, and numerous smaller aggregates of immune cells called cryptopatches and isolated lymphoid follicles, which will be largely included within the fraction of lamina propria lymphocytes."
"Continuously exposed to environmental cues and highly susceptible for pathogen assault, the intestine bears sophisticated and complex immune cell networks specific to each of the compartments [853]."
"In order to study the immune cells resident in both compartments of the murine intestine, a refined isolation of intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) is advised according to the following protocols.1.10.3."
Step-by-step sample preparation of lymphocytes from the mouse small intestine1.10.3.1.

Transfer it to a 50 mL falcon tube (n1) in ice with PBSVortex the tubes to further clean the intestineTransfer the tissue to a new clean 50 mL falcon (n2) containing 10mL of the pre-warmed IEL isolation medium.
"Note that some protocols recommend to cut the small intestine into smaller pieces (sized 0.5–2 cm), which may help to avoid the formation of knots or clews.Shake the tube in the vortex for 30secondsIncubate the 50 mL falcon tubes at 37°C and 220 rpm for 15 min."
(inside plastic beakers—4–5 tubes-or in a falcon tube support fixed to the shaker plate)After incubation vortex each tube for 10 sTransfer the solution to a new 50 mL tube (n3) containing ≈15–20 mL of ice cold complete T cell medium.
"If you prefer to cut the small intestine into pieces (see point 6), than you should use a cell strainer here to retain the tissue.Repeat steps 5–9 for two more times (using the same tube - n2).Wash the intestine one last time with 10 mL of cold complete T cell medium and a kick vortex."
Transfer the wash to the respective tubes (n3).
For the LPL isolation keep the intestines in a falcon tube on ice and proceed with the LPL protocol.Centrifuge the tubes (n3) at 1250 rpm for 10 min at 4°CAspirate the supernatantResuspend the pellet in 4mL of the 40% Percoll in complete T cell medium (5 mL per sample) and transfer to a 15 mL tubeWash the 50 mL tube with 1 mL of the 40% Percoll solution and transfer to the same 15 mL tubeUnder lay the 80% Percoll in complete T cell medium (3 ml per sample) and centrifuge the tubes at 2400 rpm for 30min at RT (1 up and 1 down)Remove the waste on top and recover the pinkish/white ring in-between the two phases.

"Data analyses of mouse iIELs and LPLsThe intestinal mucosa harbors lymphocytes, which are responsible not only for its protection but also to maintain integrity."
Scattered along the intestinal epithelia IELs are a heterogeneous population of T cells.
"Distinguished by their development and origin, IELs can be divided in two populations: the “natural” and the “induced” IELs."
"Derived from conventional aß T cells expressing CD4 (TCRαß+CD4+) and classical CD8αβ molecules (TCRαß+CD8αß+), “induced” IELs relocate in the intestine mucosal tissue after cognate antigen engagement in the periphery and accumulate over time [853]."
"On the other hand, “natural” IELs differentiate in the thymus and characterized by their TCRs ability to recognize self-antigens."
Composed of both γδ T cells and αβ T cells the large majority of “natural” IELs express the homodimer CD8αα but neither CD4 or CD8αβ [855] (Figs.
113A and 114A).
"Moreover, acquisition of surface markers during development such as CD103 (αE integrin), α4β7 and CCR9 ensure homing and tissue residency of IELs [856]."
"In addition, “natural” CD8αα+ IELs display a chronically activated phenotype which can be translated by the expression of some activation markers such as CD69, CD122, and CD44 [857].Open in a separate windowFigure 113.Representative gating strategy for TCRγδ+ population analysis of (A) murine small intestine intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and (B) lamina propria (LPL)."

"After isolation, lymphocytes were stained with Zombie (Live/Dead - Biolegend), CD45 (104- Biolegend), Tcrß (REA318 - Miltenyi), TCRγ/δ (GL3 - Biolegend), CD8α (53–6.7- Biolegend), CD8β (YTS156.7.7 - Biolegend) and CD4 (GK1.5 - Biolegend).Interestingly, γδ T cells homing in the small intestine display a biased expression of TCRγ chains according to their localization."
"While γδ IELs are mostly Vγ7+, γδ T cells that home in the γδ LPLs express a broader variety of TCRγ chains (Figure 113) [797, 802].Whereas the small intestine epithelium is enriched in “unconventional” CD8αα+ γδ T cells, approximately 60% of all lymphocytes (Figure 114A), the lamina propria is mostly composed of conventional aß T cells expressing CD8αß and CD4 (Figure 114B) [855]."
"Thereby, frequencies of CD4+ aß T cells within the iIEL preparation, and CD8αα+ aß T cells within the LPL preparation serve as reliable indicators of the level of unavoidable cross contamination during the isolation process.1.10.6."
PitfallsBe cautious to not exceed the incubation times point 8 (IEL) and point 3 (LPL) as this would decrease viability and yield of the protocols.1.10.7.

Human CD4 and CD8 T cells1.11.1.
OverviewThe use of FCM allows for high resolution delineation of T cell heterogeneity.
"Different features of the remarkable heterogeneity of memory, but also seemingly naïve, T cells can be addressed depending on the questions raised."
"T cell heterogeneity can be delineated by addressing surface markers or intranuclear transcription factors indicative for differentiation stages, chemokine receptors to address homing capacities, and production of cytokines to assess functional stages."
Depending on the resolution required for monitoring T cell heterogeneity best is to combine multiple of these aspects.1.11.2.
IntroductionThe body is under constant threat of pathogen attack.
Microbes and viruses lurk in the environment and are evolutionary adapted to seize every opportunity to invade the system.
The network of cells that make up the immune system works tightly together to protect against novel but also persistent pathogens.
If pathogens manage to get through the body's physical barriers the first line of immunological defense is made up of innate immune cells.
Innate cells are rapidly activated by pathogen-associated molecules in a nonantigen specific way.
"As a consequence, innate cells can react equally well to a variety of pathogens."
"Simultaneously, innate cell activation also paves the way for the second line of immunological defense by presenting antigen processed peptides, which primes the adaptive phase of the T-cell response."
"After priming in the secondary organs, T cells migrate to the affected tissue where they execute cytotoxicity and other effector functions."
"In addition, antigen-specific T-cell memory is formed."
"T-cell immunity is complex and there are an increasing number of subsets defined by differentiation stage, function, and cellular location."
"In the last decades, FCM proved itself to be the key technology to study heterogeneity among human T-cell subsets."
"However, as the options for multicolor FCM panel design emerged due to technical innovation, this went hand-in-hand with the increasing complexity to define T-cell subsets."
"As new T cell subsets are defined at increasing rates, it is virtually impossible to be complete."
"Hence, in this section we will review the best-established cellular markers that can be measured to shed light on these complexities.Conventional human T cells are a subpopulation of lymphocytes that can be characterized by the expression of a T-cell receptor (TCR), through which they can recognize peptides presented in the context of HLA-molecules."
The conventional TCR is composed of a transmembrane alpha- and beta-chain heterodimer that is embedded in the cell membrane in combination with the CD3 protein complex.
"In the thymus, T cells mature and develop into two main cell lineages of CD4+ and CD8+ single positive T cells that are released as naïve cells, bearing either an αβ-TCR or γδ-TCR, into the circulation (Fig."
115).
The lack of expression of any of these markers identifies a third fraction of T cells in the periphery.
These so called double-negative T cells (DN) are a legitimate component of the immune system but remain poorly understood [858].
"In the periphery, large numbers of naïve T cells (TN) survey the secondary lymphoid tissues and blood for cognate antigen."
"In response to antigen exposure, TN start to proliferate and differentiate rapidly into large numbers of effector and memory precursor T cells."
"Following pathogen clearance, the majority of effector cells die while the memory precursor cells develop into long-lived memory T cells [696, 859]."
"Although the precise model of T-cell differentiation has not been fully deciphered, two models, progressive versus asymmetric differentiation, are currently discussed that explain how T cells diversify into effector and memory subsets."
Despite this discussion a consensus was reached about markers that define naïve and memory T-cell subsets [860].
"Markers that can be used to phenotypically differentiate both CD4+ and CD8+TN, effector, and memory cells are two of the four isoforms of the CD45 family."
"While TN and effector T cell (TE RA+) express the CD45RA molecule, both the central memory (TCM) and the effector type RA- (TE RA-) cells preferentially express CD45R0 and lack CD45RA, CD45RB, and CD45RC."
To identify TN the CD45RA marker should be combined with minimally one additional marker.
"Markers that can be used include the L-selectin CD62L, which guides T cells to the lymph nodes."
"Expression of this marker can only be honestly assessed using freshly isolated cells, as cryopreservation results in a profound decrease of CD62L expression [861]."
"In addition the homing marker CCR7, costimulatory molecules CD27 and CD28 and adhesion molecule CD31 are used to define TN."
Although the preferred marker to identify TN appears redundant it is important to realize that little differences may be observed by using different markers.
"Furthermore, there will be small populations of naïve-like but differentiated T cells not accounted for that require the use of specific additional markers to be identified among naïve T cells."
"These include regulatory CD4+ T cells (Treg), stem cell memory T cells (Tscm), and virtual memory T cells (TVM) [862].Open in a separate windowFigure 115.Gating of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood."
Lymphocytes are identified on based of the FSC and SSC.
Single cells are discriminated from doublets by plotting the pulse width and height against each other for both the SSC and FSC.
CD3+ T cells are gated and excluded from apoptotic cells by viability dye.
Including dead cells can result in large errors because of their property to bind nonspecifically to antibody conjugates.
"Although not applied here, in the same channel other cell types may be excluded by using a DUMP channel, meaning a channel that contains all cellular markers in one color that should be excluded e.g."
"Abs against CD14 (monocytes), CD19, and CD21 (B cells)."
Peripheral blood ratios of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells vary from donor to donor.
A normal CD4:CD8 ratio is between 1 and 2.
Low frequencies of double negative CD3+CD4−CD8− cells are common and contain populations of NKT cells.1.11.3.
"CD4 T-cell differentiationTo date, the most appreciated model to define CD4+ T-cell differentiation stages relies on the differential expression of adhesion and chemokine receptors (Fig."
"117A, Tables 23 and ​and24).24)."
Naive CD4+ TN can be recognized by the mutual expression of CD45RA and CD27 combined with a bright CCR7 staining.
Below we describe a model by which eight different antigen-experienced CD4+ T cell subsets can be distinguished.
Type 1 helper (TH1) cells are critical for cell-mediated immunity as they produce vast amounts of the anti-viral IFN-γ (Fig.
"117B, Table 25)."
"TH1 cells can be identified by the expression of CXCR3, which guides these cells to the infected tissues."
Other chemokine receptors expressed by TH1 are CCR5 and CXCR6 [863].
"While TH1 cells are critical for cell-mediated immunity, CD4+TH2 cells are traditionally considered to support activation of other leucocytes such as B cells and are associated with the production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (Fig."
"117B, Table 25)."
"However, latest insights suggest that TH2 are not the principal B helper cells but are crucial for IL-5 mediated activation of eosinophils."
TH2 cells are enriched in the CCR4 positive fraction and some express the surface marker CRTH2 [864].
"TH2 can be further distinguished by the variable co-expression of other chemokine receptors including CCR3, CCR6, CCR8, and CCR10 [865]."
Caution is required when using CCR4 as expression is shared by TH17 and TH22 cells.
"Differentiation of T cells into TH1 and TH2 subsets is controlled in a biphasic model by the transcription factors T-bet and GATA binding protein3 (GATA3) [720, 866]."
"T-bet has been shown to antagonize GATA-3, the master regulator differentiation and maintenance of TH2 cells [867]."
"In recent years, TH subsets have been identified that differ from the traditional TH1 and TH2 subsets by the preferential production of IL-9 (TH9), IL-17 (TH17), and IL-22 (TH22) (Fig."
"117B, Table 25); multiple functions have been attributed to the IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) driven TH9 cells of which a significant fraction expresses CCR3, CCR6, and CXCR3 [868], and the pro-inflammatory TH17 cells play an important role in pathogen clearance of extracellular pathogens at barrier sites."
"In humans, TH17 cells can be identified by the mutual expression of CCR6, and CD161 [869]."
"The TH17 lineage can be further divided into more or less cytotoxic subsets based on the selective expression of CXCR3 (TH17/TH1) and CCR4, respectively [870]."
Several studies have demonstrated that a fraction of TH17 can also secrete IFN-γ besides IL-17 [870–872] (Fig.
"117B, Table 25)."
These cells are generally referred to as TH17/TH1 cells.
More recently a third subset of TH17 was characterized that harbored regulatory T cell features.
"These cells can be identified by the production of IL-10, which can be also produced by subsets of TREG, referred to as Type 1 regulatory (TR1) cells, and rare effector CD4 T cells (Fig."
117B) [873–876].
Differentiation of TH17 cells is driven by the expression of RAR-related orphan receptor γ t (RORγt) which controls IL-17 transcription [721].
"In addition, the skin-homing TH22 cells appeared to be regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) transcription factor and can be identified by the mutual expression of CCR6, CCR4, and CCR10 [877, 878]."
"Finally, a decade ago a specific subset of TH cells was discovered that resided in B-cell areas of follicular regions in secondary lymphoid tissues."
"Consequently, these cells were named follicular helper cells (TFH) and are identified by the constitutive expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR5."
"Since their discovery multiple TFH and TFH-like circulating cells have been characterized based on the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), CXCR3, CCR6, and the secretion of IL-21 (Fig."
"117B, Table 25) [879]."
TFH differentiation is orchestrated by the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and is elementary for the activation of B cells in germinal centers and are therefore crucial for the induction of humoral immune responses [880].
The relationship between follicular BCL6+ TFH and circulating TFH-like cells is still largely unclear.
"Finally, CD4+ T cells can also directly mediate viral clearance and suppress tumor growth through cytotoxic function."
Loaded with cytotytic molecules such as Granzyme B and perforin these cells can be identified by the surface expression of the Fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 and the lack of CD28 (Fig.
"117A, Table 24) [881].Open in a separate windowFigure 117.Adhesion, chemokine and cytokine receptor expression identify up to eight functional subsets within the human CD4+ memory pool."
"Peripheral blood derived CD4+ T cells can be divided between naïve, cytotoxic, and eight different T-helper subsets based on the surface expression of (A) CCR4, CCR6, CXCR3, CXCR5, CX3CR1, CD28, and CD161 and (B) production of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22."
For detection cells were stimulated with Ionomycin and PMA in the presence of BFA and MN.

CD8+ T-cell differentiationSeveral markers are proposed in combination with CD45RA/R0 to precisely define phenotypically different CD8+ T-cell subsets.
"Among these markers is CD27, a member of the TNF receptor family that promotes survival of T cells, CCR7, a chemokine receptor that mediates LN homing, and the co-stimulatory molecule CD28, which is required for T-cell activation and survival (Fig."
"116, Table 22) [882–885]."
mAbs directed against these markers are widely available and conjugated to plenty of different fluorescent dyes that enables broad application in various multicolor phenotyping panels.
The 4D model to address T-cell differentiation stages starts with TN (CD27+CD28+CCR7+CD45RA+).
"After priming TN differentiate through early-differentiated (CD27+CD28+CCR7−CD45RA−), early-like (CD27−CD28+CCR7−CD45RA−), and intermediately differentiated (CD27+CD28−CCR7−CD45RA−) T cells to give rise to TE RA+ (CD27−CD28−CCR7− CD45RA+), TE RA-(CD27−CD28−CCR7−CD45RA−) and TCM (CD27+CD28+CCR7+CD45RA−) cells."
TE RA- are memory cells that in contrast to TCM lack constitutive expression of CCR7.
"In healthy individuals without any clinical signs of viral infection, from now on referred to as steady state, naïve and early differentiated type form the most abundant circulating CD8+ T-cell subsets."
In humans that are chronically infected with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) or HIV the effector type RA+ also contributes substantially to the CD8+ T cell compartment composition.
Similar phenotypic heterogeneity exists in the CD4+ T cell compartment although subdivisions of differentiation stage based on the expression of CD28 and CCR7 are not generally recognized.
"However, although effector type CD4+ T cells are virtually absent during steady state, increasing evidence suggests that cytolytic CD4+ T cells play an important role during infections and these cells are appreciated to lack CD28 expression [881, 886].Open in a separate windowFigure 116.A 4D model to address T-cell differentiation stages."
"At least seven stages of T-cell differentiation can be distinguished for peripheral blood derived CD8+ T cells by using the markers; CD45RA, CD27, CD28, and CCR7."
"Phenotyping and gating of T cells in peripheral blood according to backbone described in Figure 115.Table 22.A four-dimensional model to address T-cell differentiation stagesSubsetExpressionNumberNameCD27CD45RACCR7CD281TN++++2TCM+−++3Early+−−+4Intermediately+−−−5Early-like−−−+6TE RA−−−−−7TE RA+−+−−Open in a separate windowIn multiple well established models of CD8+ T cell differentiation during acute infection, expression of the IL-7 receptor α-chain (CD127) is used to discriminate between the short-lived effector cells (SLEC) and the memory-precursor effector cells (MPEC) [887]."
"Although mice and human differ significantly in life span and pathogen encounter, immune cell gene expression demonstrated high similarities [888, 889]."
"In humans, the combined use of these markers is less established and combinations of different markers have been used to define T-cell differentiation during acute infections."
"In combination with the cell-surface markers CD45RA and CD27, the human equivalent of MPEC cells can be identified by an increased expression of CD127 that goes hand-in-hand with a decreased expression of the killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) (Fig."
118).
"In addition, the human equivalent of SLEC can be identified by the selective expression of KLRG1."
"In contrast to the bi-phasic model in mice, the majority of the human effector CD8+ T-cell compartment consists of double positive effector cells (DPEC)."
"In addition, low number of early effector cells (EEC) can be identified that lack both CD127 and KLRG1 expression."
"Although these markers can be used to define distinct subsets in the circulation and lymph nodes during the acute phase and in “steady state” in humans [890], it remains to be elucidated to what degree these populations are functionally comparable between both species.Open in a separate windowFigure 118.Effector CD8+ T-cell differentiation during acute infection using KLRG1 and CD127."
"In humans four different effector populations can be identified during acute infection based on the expression of KLRG1, CD127, CD45RA, and CD27."
Phenotyping and gating of T cells in peripheral blood according to backbone described in Fig.

Transcriptional regulation of human T-cell differentiationThe relationship between phenotype and function has been subject of much investigation.
"Although the association between the above mentioned surface markers and T-cell function are mostly well established, ultimately not all phenotypically similar T cells share the same cell fate and effector response."
The emerging complexity among T-cell subsets and their potential to elicit a plethora of effector functions require a more thorough characterization of each subset that would reflect its function.
The actual regulator of T-cell development and function is the circuitry of transcription factor expression.
Complex interactions of transcription factors drive expression of target genes that ultimately determine T cell functionality and many use opposing mechanisms to counter-regulate each other [741].
Multicolor FCM is the preferred method of choice to detect low frequent T-cell subsets with differential transcription factor expression within heterogeneous T-cell populations.
"As these factors bind to DNA, they are concentrated in the nucleus."
To allow Abs to reach their nuclear epitopes T cells need to be fixated and permeabilized.
There is a variety of commercial kits and procedures available to accommodate these stainings.
Permeabilization may induce cell shrinkage and loss of surface marker staining intensity and protocols should therefore be validated and optimized.
Generally the FSC and SSC voltage are amplified for intracellular protein staining.
The CD8+ T-cell lineage is enriched for cytolytic cells (CTL) that are very effective in direct lysis of infected target cells.
During chronic infections CTL-like cells can also be detected among the CD4+ lineage.
These cells can be recognized by the expression of Granzyme B (GZMB) and Perforin that are stored in acidic lysosomes (Fig.
119A).
"Differentiation of CTL, but also TH1 differentiation was demonstrated to be regulated by expression of the T-box transcription factor Tbx21 (T-bet) [732]."
"While T-bet drives terminal differentiation of effector T cells, expression of a second T-box transcription factor, Eomesodermin (Eomes), enables TH1 cells to generate memory with a certain degree of redundancy (Fig."
"119B) [885, 891]."
"In addition, Eomes expression can also be used to define a subset of Treg cells, referred to as TR1 cells that lacks FoxP3 expression and produces IL-10 [875, 876]."
"Recently, the zinc finger protein ZNF683 (Hobit) was identified as a transcriptional regulator of CD8+ and CD4+ effector type T cells in humans and the lack of CD28 (Fig."
"117A) [892, 893]."
Expression of Hobit strongly correlates with T-bet and regulates production of IFN-γ (Fig.
119C).
"To prevent immune-mediated pathology by ongoing effector function and unrestricted expansion of CTL and TH1 cells, the stimulatory activities of these subsets are counterbalanced by natural and induced Tregs."
"These suppressor cells are CD4+ T cells, exert their modulatory function by direct interaction with target cells, by the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-β and IL-10 and by increasing the consumption of IL-2."
Two lineages of Treg cells can be distinguished in humans.
"Both express the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) and the transcription factor forkhead box 3 (FoxP3) and can be distinguished by the expression of the transcription factor Helios [767, 768, 894] (Fig."
119D).
"Although in mice the expression of Helios is used to identify natural and peripheral induced Treg cells, that developed in the thymus or periphery, respectively [775], this model is controversial in humans.Open in a separate windowFigure 119.T-cell subsets as identified by intracellular staining of transcription factors and cytolytic molecules."
Peripheral blood derived CD3+ T cells are divided between CTL and TH cells.
(A) CTL can be identified by the mutual expression of GZMB and Perforin.
(B) CTL but also TH 1 cells can be identified within the CD8 and CD4 lineage by the expression of T-bet and further divided by the expression of Eomes.
(C) Hobit expression strongly correlates with T-bet expression in CD8+ T cells.
(D) Treg cells can be identified among the CD25+CD4+ T cells by the expression of FoxP3 and Helios.
Phenotyping and gating of T cells in peripheral blood according to backbone described in Figure 115.1.11.6.
Human T-cell effector functionTo define specific T-cell subsets on basis of cytokine production usually in vitro stimulation is required.
"Since cytokines are not preformed, their levels are typically low in resting cells."
Accumulation of cytokines within the ER is achieved by adding an inhibitor of protein transport to stimulated cells.
The two most frequently used inhibitors are Monensin (MN) and Brefeldin A (BFA).
The choice of protein transport inhibitor is very important as they can have differential effects on surface and intracellular protein expression after stimulation.
"For example, BFA will help to maximize the capture of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17 but blocks the surface expression of the T-cell activation marker CD69 (Fig."
120A).
"In addition, MN maximizes the detection of the T-cell degranulation marker CD107 (Fig."
120B).
After polyclonal stimulation of T cells cytokines are produced with different kinetics.
For most cytokines a stimulation and accumulation period of 4–6 h is optimal.
"However, for several cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-12 the production kinetics are relatively slow and up to 24 h stimulation may be required for optimal detection."
"As both MN and BFA are toxic, exposure of stimulated cells should be limited."
"Consequently, for the longer stimulations (>6 h) MN and BFA may be added during the last 4–6 h. MN was demonstrated to be less toxic and can be added for periods up to 24 h. When there is no prior knowledge regarding the specific cytokines that will be produced by the stimulated T cells, expression of activation induced markers can be considered."
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells depict CD69 and HLA-DR expression as early as 4 h after stimulation.
Other markers like the CD8+ biased 4–1BB (CD137) and the CD4+ T-cell biased CD40L (CD154) peak at 24 h after stimulation.
One problem with defining T-cell phenotypes after stimulation is the internalization of TCR and the CD4 and CD8 coreceptors.
"This will result in a decreased staining intensity for CD4, CD8, and especially CD3, which makes it more difficult to define T cells."
"By either staining the cells before stimulation or by intracellular staining of these markers, this problem can be circumvented.Open in a separate windowFigure 120.Detection of cytokine production and degranulation after stimulation of T cells."
Peripheral blood T cells were stimulated for 4 h with Iono and PMA or medium control in the presence of BFA and MN.
(A) Stimulated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were stained for expression of IFN-γ and IL-2.
(B) TNF-α production was captured in combination with degranulation of stimulated CD8+ T cells as detected by capture of CD107.

Human tissue resident memory T cells1.12.1.
"OverviewResident memory T cells (TRM) reside in human tissues, ranging from peripheral organs such as skin to internal organs such as the liver."
These TRM are specifically programmed to remain within these tissue compartments there within providing protection.
Techniques to isolate and identify human TRM by FCM were developed and verified by multiple research groups and are described below.1.12.2.
IntroductionIn the last decade a subset of memory T cells has been identified that is specifically adapted for survival and function within tissues.
"These so-called tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) are important for rapid local protection within tissues and can be identified by a variety of markers, including adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors."
The vast majority of human T cell knowledge has been based on T cells isolated from peripheral blood due to the lack of tissue accessibility until recent years.
"Both CD8+ and CD4+ TRM have been identified in human skin, lung, intestines, salivary glands, bone marrow, brain, spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes [895–903]."
"In mice, the existence of TRM was proven by parabiosis experiments (see Section 1.4 Murine resident memory T cells)."
"In humans, the possibilities of validating TRM are far fewer, but recently the maintenance of TRM in the lung was shown by transplantation [904].TRM lack the expression of lymph node homing molecule CCR7 and tissue egress molecule S1PR1."
Human TRM have a memory phenotype CD45RA−CD45RO+ and CCR7−CD27+/−CD28+/−.
The most widely/classical used marker of TRM is CD69.
CD69 that inhibits the function of S1PR1 so TRM are not attracted to the high SIP gradient in the blood and lymph and therefore retains T cells within tissues [905].
It should be noted that in mice it was shown that CD69 is an imperfect marker of TRM as TRM lacking CD69 also exist [906].
"However, markers categorizing TRM within CD69− T cells in human tissues are yet to be confirmed."
"Furthermore, CD69 is a classical activation markers, which should be kept in mind especially when performing functional assays."
"TRM do not express other classical activation markers, such as CD25, CD38, or HLA-DR [895, 897, 902, 907]."
"An identifier of TRM at mucosal sites is CD103 (α subunit of αEβ7 integrin), which helps TRM dock to E-cadherin expressing epithelial cells [908]."
"These TRM co-express CD69 and CD103 and are found mainly in the skin, lung, salivary glands, brain, and intestines [899–902]."
"TRM reside in other tissues, such as the liver and bone marrow, and in these tissues TRM express CD69 but not CD103."
"TRM also express chemokine receptors CXCR6, CXCR3, CCR5, and integrin CD49a (α subunit of α1β1 integrin) throughout the different tissues."
"CD69+ TRM lack the expression of CX3CR1, mainly expressed by effector T cells.TRM are polyfunctional and rapidly produce cytokines upon stimulation [900, 901], which can be quantified with in vitro stimulation in the presence of brefeldin A and staining for cytokines intracellularly."
In the skin CD49a identifies CD8+ TRM poised for cytotoxic function [909].
This rapid effector function needs to be tightly controlled in order to protect the tissues where TRM reside.
"Inhibitory receptors PD-1, CTLA-4, and 2B4 are expressed by TRM [899–901], which may control the effector function of these TRM.In the recent years, TRM have also taken the spotlight in cancer immunotherapy."
The use of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and Ab immunotherapy were one of the big breakthroughs of cancer immunotherapy.
Further research revealed that the presence of CD103+CD8+ TILs are a positive prognostic marker in several cancers [910–913].
"A subset of TILs in tumors of NSCLC share the phenotype of TRM in adjacent lung tissue (expression of CD103, CD69, CXCR6, CD49a) [913, 914]."
"A proportion of PD-1++ TILs with a TRM phenotype also express CXCL13, the ligand of CXCR5 [914–916]."
"Furthermore, tumors consist of tumor-specific TILs as well as tumor nonspecific T cells so-called bystander T cells."
"While tumor-specific TILs express high levels of CD39, the bystander T cells lack CD39 expression [917].In order to further unravel the heterogeneity of human TRM Single cell RNA-sequencing platforms should be utilized and the results obtained from these experiments should be validated by multicolor FCM and functional assay.1.12.3."
Step-by-step sample preparation1.12.3.1.
"Isolation of human TRM The following protocol was designed for isolating mononuclear cells from various tissues, including intestines, lung, and tumor tissue, described previously [895, 918].Cut tissue into small pieces and incubated for 1–2 h at 37°C in digestion medium while shaking/rollingDissociate the tissue using gentleMACS® Tissue Dissociator (Miltenyi)Pass the digested tissue through a flow-through chamber to achieve a single cell suspensionAfter centrifugation, incubate the samples with 50 μg/mL DNase for 15 min in a 37°C water bathTo isolate mononuclear cells from the cell suspension, use standard Percoll density gradient techniqueIsolated mononuclear cells can be used directly for experimentation or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until further analysisFor cryopreservation, resuspend cells in cold FCM buffer and add the same volume of 2× freeze medium dropwise and take directly to cryo.1.12.3.2."

Data analysis and gatingFor analysis of FCM data FACS Diva (BD) or FlowJo (Tree Star) software should be used.
"First, lymphocytes and single cells should be gated, after which the compensations should be checked."
Single stainings should be used for compensation controls.
After the compensations are adjusted the analysis can continue.
General gating includes exclusion of dead cells using a live/dead fixable dye (in this case Near-IR from Thermofisher) and gating on CD3+ cells to distinguish T cells.
CD3+ T cells should then be separated into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
The common markers of TRM are CD69 and CD103 (as shown in Fig.
"121), but many more markers have been identified up to now (described above and listed in Tables 27 and ​and2828).Open in a separate windowFigure 121.Gating strategy for human TRM."
"The above gating strategy is shown for human lung tissue TRM, but similar gating strategies apply for other tissues."
"Side (SSC) and forward (FSC) scatter are used to gate on lymphocytes, followed by gating out doublets also using SSC and FSC."
Live/dead marker Near-IR is used to gate out dead cells and CD3 eVolve605 to gate on T cells.
"To gate out aggregates, CD45RA QDot655 and CD27 PE-CF594 are used."
Whether or not this aggregate gating is necessary depends on your antibodies and cells used.
"To distinguish between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4 BUV737 and CD8 BUV805 are used."

"PitfallsIsolation of T cells from human tissues often requires enzymatic digestion with collagenases, which can affect the expression of certain proteins, particularly chemokine receptors, such as CCR6 [920], due to their large structure and multiple transmembrane domains."
This should be kept under consideration when staining tissues that have undergone enzymatic digestion.
"The preferred collagenase used by multiple research groups is collagenase D [895, 899, 901]."
"Furthermore, cryopreservation can also affect expression of proteins, such as L-selectin/CD62L."
"Various markers of TRM are shared between tissues, but it should be kept in mind that some markers and ratios of certain populations can vary per tissue compartment."
"The amount of unconventional T cells, such as TCR-γδ, MAIT cells and NK T cells, should also be determined, which varies per tissue."
"If there are significant amounts of these unconventional T cells, a dump channel should be applied.1.12.7."
"Tips/tricksCareful panel design is important with more than 10 color flowThe major problem is the scatter caused by compensation of some fluorochromes, not per se the amount needed to compensateSome examples of compensation issuesTo use BUV805, BV737, and BV785 in the same panel, BD FACSymphony is requiredBUV661 spills into APC so BUV661 signal should not be too bright and APC signal should be relatively brightBUV737 spills into BUV805 so using markers that are clearly distinct from each other such as CD4 and CD8 is advisableA lot of compensation is required between BV605 and BV650Properly titrating antibodies and not using antibodies at too high concentrations can significantly helpSome tissues suffer from autofluorescenceIt can help to keep a Brilliant violet channel empty or sometimes the autofluorescence can be gated out when two fluorochromes, where no double positive signal is expected, are plotted against each otherIsotype controls or FMOs (fluorescence minus one) should be used if there is only a shift in a population instead of a clear staining/bimodal populationsTo avoid aggregates caused by some fluorochromes, the antibody mixes can be centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 min."
"Afterwards the aggregates should be pelleted and the antibody mix should not be pipetted from the bottom of the tube or resuspended again.A dump channel may be necessary for unconventional T cells such as TCR-γδ, MAIT cells, and NK T cells and these can be for example put in the same channel as the live/dead marker to exclude them1.13."
"Immune senescence (aging) of human T cellsIn human aging, the functionality of the adaptive immune system diminishes, known as immunosenescence."
Immunosenescence leads among others to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases through diminished responses to pathogens [921].
"In addition, a continual low-grade pro-inflammatory milieu is associated with aging (inflammaging), which is linked to several aging-associated diseases with an inflammatory pathophysiology such as various neurodegenerative [922] and metabolic diseases [923], leading to increased mortality."
There is great interest in the physiology of aging to better understand the aging process and techniques to monitor them.
"Within the T-cell repertoire, aging is known to lead to a loss of naïve T-cells, with a reciprocal increase in effector memory T-cells [921]."
This process is fueled among others due to involution of the thymus from adolescence onward.
This naïve T-cells fraction is conventionally studied by FCM using Abs against a panel of (co-stimulatory) surface antigens such as CD28 [924].
See Table 29 for examples of commonly used FCM markers for the identification of aged human T cells.
The decrease of the naïve T-cell population is accompanied by an increase of oligoclonal effector memory populations [925].
"This process is driven by latent viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV)."
"Especially in the oldest-old individuals, large proportions of the T-cell repertoire seems to be occupied by CMV-specific effector memory T-cells [926]."
"Therefore, when studying human aging in T-cells, the CMV seroposivity status of the subject must be taken into account."
"Age-associated T-cell dysfunction include replicative senescence that is characterized by the expression of CD57 and KLRG1, which were found to be increased in both CD4 and CD8+ T-cells in the elderly [927]."
"Other age related processes include perturbations in T-cell homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction, which can both be assessed using FCM."
"For example, a recent study found that while mitochondrial mass increased in CD8+ T-cells with age, they exhibited a diminished membrane potential, indicating a loss of mitochondrial function which was accompanied by an increase of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species [928]."
"Another process, which is known to be vital to T-cell homeostasis during aging, is autophagy."
Lysosomal degradation of defective proteins and recycling thereof is critical for the homeostasis of the metabolically active T-cell.
"Indeed, in T-cells of older individuals a decreased (basal) autophagy level was found [430], with lower levels in effector memory T-cells [929]."
"Most methods to quantify changes in autophagy (see Chapter V Section 9: Autophagy) use immunoblotting (requires a protein quantity that is not always available in human aging studies) or immunofluorescence imaging (laborious and not high-throughput), however recently several flow-cytometric assays for quantifying autophagy were developed."
These assays require transfection with reporter constructs which could potentially alter the characteristics of the cells of interest [427].
"To better understand healthy aging, one approach is to study the offspring of long-lived individuals compared to their partners."
"Interestingly, the T-cells of offspring possess higher proportions of naïve T-cells [930], lower levels of senescent T-cells [927], better responses after stimulation with viral antigens [931] and improved activation-induced autophagic activity [932]."
"Finally, markers of T-cell immunosenescence can be used as biomarkers to monitor lifestyle interventions in the context of human aging."
"For example, a recent study demonstrated that high level of physical activity maintains higher levels of naïve T-cells and T-cells with phenotypes of recent thymic emigrants in the elderly, as compared to inactive elderly [933].Table 29.Examples of flow cytometry markers used to identify aged T-cells in humansMarkerExpressionFunctional implication"
